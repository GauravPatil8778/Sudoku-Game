## Sudoku Game
Welcome to the Sudoku Game, a classic and engaging number puzzle brought to life through the simplicity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a static web page that merges sleek design with interactive gameplay.

•	HTML structures the layout and interface of the game.

•	CSS enhances the visuals, making the game both visually appealing and user-friendly.

•	JavaScript drives the game's logic, ensuring smooth gameplay and user interaction.

## What is Sudoku?
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle that requires filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. It is a test of pattern recognition and deduction, requiring careful thought and strategy to complete.

## How to Play:
1.	The puzzle begins with some numbers already placed on the grid.
2.	Your goal is to fill in the empty cells.
3.	Make sure that:
   > Every row contains the numbers 1 through 9, without any duplicates.

   > Every column also contains the numbers 1 through 9, without repeats.

   > Each 3x3 subgrid (highlighted within the larger grid) also contains the numbers 1 through 9, without repetition.

Sudoku is a game of logic and concentration. There’s no guessing—each placement should be a result of deduction based on the current numbers on the board.
