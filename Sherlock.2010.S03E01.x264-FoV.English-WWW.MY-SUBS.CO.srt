1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,780
'Sherlock!'

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,900
'It's a trick.'

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,060
Just a magic trick.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,500
No. All right, stop it now.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,420
'Now, stay exactly where you are.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,260
'Don't move.' All right.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,740
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,820
'Please, would you do this for me?'

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,660
Do what?

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,340
'This phone call, it's er...'

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,900
..it's my note.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,780
It's what people do, don't they?

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,780
'Leave a note.'

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,220
Leave a note when?

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,300
'Goodbye, John.'

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,020
No. Don't...

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,740
Sherlock!

18
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,060
John.

19
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,740
John, look at me. Look at me.

20
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,940
And sleep.

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,300
Right the way down, right the way
deep, right the way, sound asleep.

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,300
That's real.

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,340
That's good, with my voice just
there in the centre of your head

24
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,980
and floating all the way around you.

25
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,700
And you will awaken in three,
two, one...

26
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,060
..zero.

27
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,620
Let me come through please!
He's my friend.

28
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,180
'Bollocks!'

29
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,900
No, no, no, no, it's obvious.

30
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,540
That's how he did it. It's obvious.

31
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,420
Derren Brown?!
Let it go, Sherlock's dead.

32
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,780
But is he?

33
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,460
There was a body, it was him.

34
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,860
It was definitely him,
Molly Hooper laid him out.

35
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,140
No, she's lying.

36
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,980
It was Jim Moriarty's body
with a mask on.

37
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,620
A mask?

38
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,460
A bungee rope, a mask,
Derren Brown.

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,580
Two years and the theories
keep getting more stupid.

40
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,060
How many more have you got
for me today?

41
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,260
Well, you know the paving slabs
in that whole area,

42
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,900
even the exact ones
that he landed on,

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,540
you know they were all... Guilt!

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,300
That's all this is.

45
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
You pushed us all into thinking

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,860
that Sherlock that was a fraud,
you and Donovan.

47
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,740
You did this and it killed him
and he's staying dead.

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,700
Do you honestly believe that
if you have enough stupid theories,

49
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
it's going to change
what really happened?

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,700
I believe in Sherlock Holmes.

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah, well,
that won't bring him back.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,140
And that after extensive
police investigations...

53
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,620
Richard Brook did indeed prove to be
the creation of James Moriarty...

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,860
'Amidst unprecedented
scenes, there was uproar in court

55
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,340
'as Sherlock Holmes was vindicated
and cleared of all suspicion.'

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,340
'Sadly, all this
comes too late for the detective,

57
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,540
'who became something of a celebrity
two years ago.'

58
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,620
Questions are now being asked as to
why police let matters get so far.

59
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,580
Sherlock Holmes fell to his death

60
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,460
from the top of London's Bart's
Hospital. Although he left no note,

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,980
friends say it's unlikely
he was able to cope with the...

62
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,060
Well then. Absent friends.

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,540
Sherlock.

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
Sherlock.

65
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,700
And may God rest his soul.

66
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
TRANSLATED FROM SERBIAN:

67
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
What?

68
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,100
Now listen to me.

69
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,980
There's an underground terrorist
network active in London

70
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,380
and a massive attack is imminent.

71
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,180
Sorry, but the holiday is over...

72
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,300
..Brother dear.

73
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,700
Back to Baker Street...

74
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,980
..Sherlock Holmes.

75
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,260
Penny for the guy?

76
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,340
Oi, mate, penny for the guy?

77
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,180
Penny for the guy, mate?
Penny for the guy?

78
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,740
Penny for the guy?
Penny for the guy?

79
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,540
'That was the most ridiculous
thing I've ever done.'

80
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,060
'You invaded Afghanistan.'

81
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,620
You have been busy, haven't you?

82
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,260
Quite the busy little bee. Hmm.

83
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,180
Moriarty's network.
Took me two years to dismantle it.

84
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,420
And you're confident you have?

85
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,980
The Serbian side was the last piece
of the puzzle.

86
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,860
Yes. You got yourself in deep there
with Baron Maupertuis.

87
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,060
Quite a scheme. Colossal.

88
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,900
Anyway. You're safe now.

89
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,580
Mmm.

90
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,260
A small "thank you"
wouldn't go amiss.

91
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,460
What for?

92
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,980
For wading in.

93
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,020
In case you've forgotten,
field work is not my natural milieu.

94
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,540
"Wading in?"

95
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,180
You sat there and watched me
being beaten a pulp.

96
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,500
I got you out. No, I got me out.

97
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,140
Why didn't you intervene sooner?

98
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,940
I couldn't risk giving
myself away, could I?

99
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,660
It would have ruined everything.
You were enjoying it. Nonsense.

100
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,220
Definitely enjoying it.

101
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,100
Listen, do you have any idea
what it was like, Sherlock,

102
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,500
going undercover?

103
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,020
Smuggling my way
into their ranks like that?

104
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,500
The noise, the people!

105
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,700
I didn't know you spoke Serbian.

106
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,620
I didn't.
But the language has a Slavic root.

107
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,460
Frequent Turkish
and German loan words.

108
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,940
Took me a couple of hours.

109
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,820
Hmm, you're slipping.

110
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,980
Middle-age, brother mine.

111
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,740
Comes to us all.

112
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,020
Oh, no, you don't take it, do you?

113
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,820
No. You forget
a little thing like that.

114
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,220
Yes.

115
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,740
You forget lots of little things,
it seems.

116
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,580
Uh-huh.

117
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,020
Not sure about that.

118
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,660
Hmm? Ages you.

119
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,100
Just trying it out.

120
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,380
Well, it ages you.

121
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,220
Look... I'm not your mother,
I've no right to expect it...

122
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,380
No... But just one phone call, John!

123
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,860
Just one phone call would have done.

124
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,540
I know.

125
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,940
After all we went through!
Yes.

126
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,100
I am sorry.

127
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,740
Look, I understand how difficult
it was for you after...

128
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,380
..after...

129
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,900
I just let it slide, Mrs Hudson,
I let it all slide.

130
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,060
And it just got harder and harder
to pick up the phone, somehow.

131
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,460
Do you know what I mean?

132
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
I need you to give this matter
your full attention, Sherlock,

133
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,460
is that quite clear? What do you
think of this shirt? Sherlock!

134
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,340
I will find your underground
terror cell, Mycroft.

135
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,820
Just put me back in London.

136
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
I need to get to know the place
again, breathe it in.

137
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,540
Feel every quiver
of its beating heart.

138
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,700
One of our men died
getting this information.

139
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,060
All the chatter,
all the traffic concurs,

140
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,980
there's going to be a terrorist
strike on London, a big one.

141
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,900
And what about John Watson?

142
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,580
John? Mm. Have you seen him?
Oh, yes,

143
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,860
we meet up every Friday
for fish and chips(!)

144
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,820
I've kept a weather eye on him,
of course.

145
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,660
We haven't been in touch at all
to...prepare him.

146
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,460
No.

147
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,620
Well, we'll have to get rid of that.

148
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,820
"We?" He looks ancient.

149
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,420
I can't be seen to be wandering
around with an old man.

150
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,100
I couldn't face letting it out.

151
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,100
He never liked me dusting.

152
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,260
No, I know.

153
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,580
So why now? What changed your mind?

154
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,140
Well, I've got some news.

155
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,620
Oh, God, is it serious?

156
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,980
What? No, no, I'm not ill.

157
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,340
I've, well, I'm...

158
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,300
..moving on.

159
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,020
You're emigrating?

160
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Nope. Er, no, I've er...

161
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,820
..I have met someone.

162
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,780
Oh! Ah, lovely.

163
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,620
Yeah. We're getting married.
Well, I'm going to ask, anyway.

164
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,060
So soon after Sherlock?

165
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,500
Hmm, well, yes.

166
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,180
What's his name?

167
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,460
It's a woman.

168
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,940
A woman?! Yes, of course
it's a woman.

169
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,700
You really have moved on, haven't
you? Mrs Hudson, how many times?

170
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,020
Sherlock was not my boyfriend!

171
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,660
Live and let live, that's my motto.

172
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,860
Listen to me - I am not gay!

173
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,180
I think I'll surprise John.
He'll be delighted.

174
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
You think so?

175
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,100
Mm, pop into Baker Street,
who knows, jump out of a cake.

176
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,620
Baker Street?
He isn't there any more.

177
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,900
Why would he be?
It's been two years.

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,740
He's got on with his life.

179
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
What life? I've been away.

180
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,180
Where's he going to be tonight?
How would I know? You always know.

181
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,660
He has a dinner reservation
in the Marylebone Road.

182
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,260
Nice little spot.

183
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,420
They have a few bottles
of the 2000 Saint-Emilion,

184
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,260
though I prefer the 2001.

185
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,220
I think maybe I'll just drop by.

186
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,460
You know, it is just possible
that you won't be welcome.

187
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,900
No, it isn't.

188
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,620
Now, where is it?
Where's what? You know what.

189
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,900
Welcome back, Mr Holmes.

190
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,940
Thank you.

191
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,180
Blud.

192
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,380
Sir, can I help you?

193
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,980
Your wife just texted you, possibly
her contractions have started.

194
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,340
Excuse me, sir.

195
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,260
Oh, sir, I am so, so sorry.

196
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,860
Er, please, let me just go to the
kitchen and dry that off for you.

197
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,340
Finished with that, sir?
Allow me to take it for you.

198
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,740
Madam, can I suggest you look at this
menu, it's completely identical.

199
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,300
Can I
help you with anything, sir?

200
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,860
Hi, yeah, I'm looking for a bottle
of champagne. A good one.

201
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,940
Hmm, well, these are all

202
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,140
excellent vintages, sir.

203
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,420
Oh, it's not really my area,

204
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,460
what do you suggest?

205
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,100
Well, you cannot possibly go wrong,

206
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,940
but if you'd like my personal

207
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,340
recommendation... Hmm?

208
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,220
This last one on the list
is a favourite of mine.

209
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,340
It is, you might in fact say,
like a face from the past.

210
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,940
Great. I'll have that one please.

211
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,580
It is familiar,
but with the quality of surprise!

212
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,300
Well, surprise me.

213
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,980
I'm certainly endeavouring to, sir.

214
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,780
Sorry that took so long.

215
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,500
You OK?

216
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,220
Yeah, yeah. Me? Fine. I am fine.

217
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,860
Now then, what did you
want to ask me?

218
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,940
More wine? No, I'm good with water,
thanks. Right.

219
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,820
So?
Er, so...

220
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,260
Mary...

221
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,300
Listen, um...

222
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,940
I know it hasn't been long,

223
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,340
and I know we haven't known
each other for a long time...

224
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,580
Go on. Yes, I will.

225
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,180
As you know, these last couple
of years haven't been easy for me.

226
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,540
And meeting you...

227
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,020
Yeah, meeting you has been
the best thing

228
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,300
that could have possibly
happened. I agree. What?

229
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,940
I agree, I'm the best thing
that could have happened to you.

230
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,860
Sorry.
Well, no, it's, um...

231
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,780
So...

232
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,660
..if you'll have me, Mary,
could you see your way, um...

233
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,340
If you could see your way to...

234
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,460
Sir, you'll find this vintage
exceptionally to your liking.

235
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,140
It has all the qualities of the old,
with the colour of the new.

236
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,020
No, sorry, not now, please. Like
a gaze from a crowd of strangers,

237
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,820
suddenly one is aware of staring
into the face of an old friend.

238
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,020
No, look, seriously,
could you just...?

239
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,260
Interesting thing, a tuxedo.

240
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,860
Lends distinction to friends
and anonymity to waiters.

241
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,460
John?

242
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
John, what is it? What?

243
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,300
Well, the short version...

244
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,580
..not dead.

245
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,540
Bit mean springing it on you
like that, I know.

246
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,980
Could have given you a heart attack,
probably still will.

247
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,700
But in my defence, it was very funny.

248
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,380
OK, it's not a great defence.

249
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh, no, you're... Oh, yes.
Oh, my God!

250
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,700
Not quite. You died,
you jumped off a roof.

251
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,060
No. You're dead.

252
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,100
No, I'm quite sure, I checked.
Excuse me.

253
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,860
Does...does yours rub off too?

254
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,180
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

255
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,820
Do you have any idea
what you've done?!

256
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,660
OK, John, I'm suddenly realising
I probably owe you

257
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,100
some sort of an apology...

258
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,820
All right, just, John, just keep...

259
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,180
Two years.

260
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,700
Two years! Hmm?

261
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,500
I thought...

262
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,380
I thought...

263
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,300
..you were dead.

264
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,500
Hmm?

265
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,580
Now, you let me grieve. Hmm.

266
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,420
How could you do that?

267
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,020
How?!

268
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,460
Wait, before you do anything
that you might regret, um,

269
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,100
one question, just let me
ask one question.

270
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,940
Are you really going to keep that?

271
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,460
I calculated that there were
13 possibilities

272
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,620
once I'd invited Moriarty
onto the roof.

273
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,980
'I wanted to avoid dying,
if at all possible.

274
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,740
'The first scenario involved hurling myself
into a parked van filled with washing bags.

275
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,300
'Impossible, the angle was too steep.
Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling...

276
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,620
'You know, for a genius,
you can be remarkably thick.'

277
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,540
What? I don't care how
you faked it, Sherlock.

278
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,380
I want to know why.

279
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,660
Why? Because Moriarty
had to be stopped.

280
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Oh.

281
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,140
Why, as in...?

282
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,220
I see. Yes. Why?

283
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,100
That's a little more difficult
to explain.

284
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,340
I've got all night.

285
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,220
Actually, um, that was
mostly Mycroft's idea.

286
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,180
Oh, so it was your brother's plan?

287
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,940
Oh, but he would have needed
a confidante.

288
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,540
Mm-hm.

289
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Sorry.

290
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,100
But he was the only one?
The only one who knew?

291
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,540
A couple of others. It was a very
elaborate plan, it had to be.

292
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,940
The next of the 13 possibilities
was... Who else?

293
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Who else knew?

294
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,180
Who?! Molly.

295
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,500
Molly?! John... Molly Hooper

296
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,740
and some of my homeless network
and that's all. OK.

297
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,740
OK.

298
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,180
So just your brother,
Molly Hooper and 100 tramps.

299
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,820
Ha, no! 25 at most.

300
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,740
Seriously, it's not a joke?
You're really keeping this?

301
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,420
Er, yeah.

302
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,020
Sure?

303
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,140
Mary likes it.

304
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,820
Hmm, no, she doesn't.

305
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,300
She does. She doesn't.

306
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,380
Oh, don't.

307
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,260
Oh, brilliant(!)
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

308
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
I didn't know how to tell you...

309
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,020
Right, no, no, this is charming.
I've really missed this(!)

310
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,740
One word, Sherlock,
that is all I would have needed!

311
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,220
One word to let me know
that you were alive!

312
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,460
I've nearly been in contact so
many times, but...

313
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,300
I worried that, you know, you might
say something indiscreet. What?

314
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,700
You know, let the cat out of the bag.
So this is my fault!

315
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,100
Oh, God! Why am I the only one
who thinks that this is wrong?!

316
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,220
The only one reacting
like a human being!

317
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,020
Over-reacting. Over-reacting!

318
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,300
John! Over-reacting! So you fake
your own death and you waltz in here

319
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,180
large as bloody life! Shh. But I'm
not meant to have a problem with it,

320
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,740
cos Sherlock Holmes thinks it's
a perfectly OK thing to do!

321
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,180
Shut up! I don't want everyone
knowing I'm still alive!

322
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,860
Oh, so it's still a secret, is it?!
Yes, it's still a secret!

323
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,500
Promise you won't tell anyone?
Swear to God!

324
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,460
London is in danger, John. There's an imminent
terrorist attack and I need your help.

325
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,540
My help?

326
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,420
You have missed this, admit it.

327
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,580
The thrill of the chase,
the blood pumping through your veins,

328
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,900
just the two of us
against the rest of the world.

329
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,020
I don't understand,
I said I'm sorry,

330
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,940
isn't that what you're supposed
to do?

331
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,780
Gosh, you don't know anything
about human nature, do you?

332
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,860
Hmm, nature? No.

333
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,740
Human? No.

334
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,860
I'll talk him round.

335
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,860
You will?
Oh, yeah.

336
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Mary.

337
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,860
Can you believe his nerve?

338
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,140
I like him.

339
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,940
What?

340
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,100
I like him.

341
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
Those things will kill you.

342
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,820
Oh, you bastard!

343
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,580
It's time to come back.

344
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,980
You've been letting things
slide, Graham.

345
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,180
Greg.
Greg.

346
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,860
'Very common belief,
with an anti terrorism bill...'

347
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,780
'..the Government feels duty-bound

348
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,380
'to push through the legislation
with all due exped...'

349
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,180
'Now, stay exactly where you are.'

350
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,460
Where are you?

351
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
'Don't move.

352
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,180
'Keep your eyes fixed on me.

353
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,340
'What? What's happening?
What's going on?'

354
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,540
Please, will you do this for me?
Please.

355
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,860
Do what?

356
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,020
'This phone call...'

357
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,700
it's my note.

358
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,100
'That's what people do,
don't they?'

359
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,300
Leave a note.

360
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,700
'Leave a note when?'

361
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,340
Goodbye, John. 'No.'

362
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,100
Sherlock!

363
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,500
Oh, ho!

364
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,260
What?! Are you out of your mind?!

365
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,780
I don't see why not.

366
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,940
It's just as plausible
as some of your theories.

367
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,220
Look, if you're not going to take it
seriously, Laura...

368
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
I do take it seriously.

369
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,980
I don't think we should wear hats.

370
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,620
I founded 'The Empty Hearse'
so like-minded people could meet,

371
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,500
discuss theories!

372
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,020
Sherlock's still out there.

373
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
I'm convinced of it.

374
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,740
Oh, my God!

375
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,220
Oh...my...God!

376
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,620
"His movements were so silent,

377
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,380
"so furtive he reminded me

378
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,980
"of a trained bloodhound
picking out a scent."

379
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,100
You what? "I couldn't help thinking
what an amazing criminal he'd make

380
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,460
"if he turned his talents
against the law." Don't read that.

381
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,940
Famous blog, finally.
Come on, that's...

382
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,260
Ancient history, yes, I know, but it's
not though, is it, because he's...

383
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,780
What are you doing?

384
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,140
Having a wash.

385
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,940
You're shaving it off.

386
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,180
Well, you hate it.
Sherlock hates it.

387
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,380
Apparently everyone hates it. Oh!

388
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,300
Are you going to see him again?
No, I'm going to work.

389
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,500
Oh, and after work, are you going
to see him again? No.

390
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,020
God, I had six months
of bristly kisses for me

391
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,940
and then his nibs turns up...

392
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,500
I don't shave for Sherlock Holmes.

393
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,300
You should put that on a T-shirt.

394
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,140
Shut up. Or what?

395
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,180
Or I'll marry you.

396
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,500
London, it's like a great cesspool
into which all kinds

397
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,620
of criminals, agents and
drifters are irresistibly drained.

398
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,980
Sometimes it's not a question of
who, it's a question of who knows?

399
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,020
If this man cancels his papers,
I need to know.

400
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,100
If this woman leaves London without
putting her dog into kennels,

401
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,660
I need to know.

402
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,700
I have certain people,
they are markers.

403
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,580
If they start to move,
I'll know something's up.

404
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,660
Like rats deserting a sinking ship.

405
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,180
All very interesting, Sherlock,

406
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,020
but the terror alert has been
raised to critical.

407
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,660
Boring. Your move.

408
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,380
We have solid information,
an attack IS coming.

409
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,740
Solid information, a secret terrorist
organisation is planning an attack...

410
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,380
That's what secret terrorist organisations do, isn't it?
It's their version of golf.

411
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,940
An agent gave his life
to tell us that. Oh, well,

412
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,620
perhaps he shouldn't have done. He was
obviously just trying to show off.

413
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,340
None of these 'markers' of yours
is behaving in any way suspiciously?

414
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,660
Your move.

415
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,500
No, Mycroft, but you have
to trust me. I'll find the answer.

416
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,700
But it'll be in an odd phrase
in an on-line blog,

417
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,580
or an unexpected trip
to the countryside,

418
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,900
or a misplaced lonely hearts ad.

419
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,940
Your move!

420
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,700
I've given the Prime Minister my
personal assurance you're on the case.

421
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,820
I am on the case, we both are,
look at us right now.

422
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,420
Oh, bugger! Whoopsy!

423
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,340
Can't handle a broken heart.
How very telling.

424
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,900
Don't be smart.

425
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,420
That takes me back.

426
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,540
"Don't be smart, Sherlock,
I'm the smart one."

427
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,900
I am the smart one.

428
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,420
I used to think I was an idiot.

429
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,620
Both of us thought you were
an idiot, Sherlock.

430
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,700
We had nothing else to go on,
until we met other children.

431
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,500
Oh, yes, that was a mistake.
Ghastly. What were they thinking of?

432
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,900
Probably something about
trying to make friends.

433
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,620
Oh, yes. Friends.

434
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,820
Of course, you go in
for that sort of thing now.

435
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,460
And you don't? Ever?

436
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,300
If you seem slow to me, Sherlock,

437
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,900
can you imagine what real people
are like?

438
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,820
I'm living in a world of goldfish.

439
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,660
Yes, but I've been away
for two years.

440
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,620
So? Oh, I don't know,

441
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,300
I thought perhaps you might have
found yourself a...

442
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,740
goldfish. Change the subject, now.

443
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,860
Rest assured, Mycroft,

444
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,140
whatever this underground
network of yours is up to,

445
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,460
the secret will reside in something
seemingly insignificant or bizarre.

446
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,060
Ooh-ooh. Speaking of which...

447
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,940
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!

448
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,780
Him sitting in his chair again.

449
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,820
Oh, isn't it wonderful, Mr Holmes?

450
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,780
I can barely contain myself(!)
Oh, he really can, you know.

451
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,860
He's secretly pleased to see you,
underneath all that.

452
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,940
Sorry, which of us?

453
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Both of you.

454
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Let's play something different.

455
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Why are we playing games?!

456
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,060
London's terror alert has been
raised to critical,

457
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm just passing the time.

458
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,340
Let's do deductions.

459
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,860
Client left this while I was out,
what do you reckon?

460
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,740
I'm busy.

461
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh, go on, it's been an age.

462
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,860
I always win.
Which is why you can't resist.

463
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,660
I find nothing irresistible in the
hat of a well-travelled anxious,

464
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,380
sentimental, unfit creature of habit
with appalling halitosis.

465
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,660
Damn.
Isolated too, don't you think?

466
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,940
Why would he be isolated?

467
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,100
"He?" Obviously.
Why? Size of the hat?

468
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,700
Don't be silly.
Some women have large heads too.

469
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,460
No, he's recently had his hair cut,

470
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,020
you can see the little hairs adhering
to the perspiration stains on the inside.

471
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,340
Some women have short hair too.

472
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,580
Balance of probability. Not that you've ever spoken
to a woman with short hair, or, you know, any woman.

473
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,420
Stains show he's out of condition.
He's sentimental because the hat

474
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,900
has been repaired, three, four...
Five times. Very neatly.

475
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,980
The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat,
so he's mawkishly attached to it. But it's more than that.

476
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,460
One patch or two patches would indicate sentimentality.
But five? Five's obsessive behaviour. Obsessive compulsive.

477
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,860
Hardly. Your client left it behind.

478
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,100
What sort of an obsessive compulsive
would do that?

479
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,420
The earlier patches are extensively
sun bleached,

480
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,860
so he's worn it abroad, in Peru.

481
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,140
Peru? This is a chullo.

482
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,660
The classic headgear of Andes,
it's made of alpaca.

483
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,340
No. No? Icelandic sheep wool.
Similar, but very distinctive,

484
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,140
if you know what you're looking for.
I've written a blog on the varying

485
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
tensile strengths of different
natural fibres.

486
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,940
I'm sure there's a crying
need for that(!)

487
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,180
You said he was anxious? The bobble on
the left side has been badly chewed,

488
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,700
which shows he's a man of a nervous
disposition, but...

489
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,100
But also a creature of habit,

490
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,660
because he hasn't chewed
the bobble on the right. Precisely.

491
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,420
A quick sniff of the offending bobble tells us all
we need to know about the state of his breath.

492
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,860
Brilliant! Elementary.

493
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,980
But you've missed his isolation.

494
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,580
I don't see it.

495
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,820
Plain as day. Where?

496
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,180
There for all to see. Tell me.

497
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,660
Plain as the nose on your... Tell me!

498
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,700
Well, anybody who wears
a hat as stupid as this

499
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,180
isn't in the habit of hanging
around other people, is he?

500
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,860
Not at all. Maybe he just
doesn't mind being different.

501
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,180
He doesn't necessarily
have to be isolated.

502
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,700
Exactly.

503
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,620
I'm sorry?

504
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,580
He's different, so what?
Why would he mind?

505
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,060
You're quite right.

506
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,100
Why would anyone mind?

507
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
I am not lonely, Sherlock.

508
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,820
How would you know?

509
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,060
Yes. Back to work,
if you don't mind. Good morning.

510
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,020
Right, back to work.

511
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,300
Mr Summerson.

512
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,140
Right. Undescended testicle.

513
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,540
Right.

514
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,500
Sherlock?
Hmm?

515
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,300
Talk to John.

516
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,060
I've tried talking to him.
He made his position quite clear.

517
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,980
Just relax, Mr Summerson.

518
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,340
What did he say?

519
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,420
F...
Cough.

520
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,100
Oh, dear.

521
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,540
Hi?

522
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,740
'Mrs Reeves. Thrush.'

523
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,380
Right.

524
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,100
You wanted to see me?

525
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,860
Yes. Molly...

526
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,940
Yes? Would you...?

527
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,100
Would you like to...
Have dinner? ..Solve crimes?

528
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,540
Um...

529
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,980
Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of,
Mrs Reeves.

530
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,580
It's very common,
but I'm recommending a course of...

531
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,900
Monkey glands,
but enough about Professor Presbury.

532
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,220
Tell us more about your case, Mr Harcourt.
You sure about this? Absolutely.

533
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,740
Should I be making notes? If it makes you feel better.
That's what John says he does.

534
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,860
So if I'm being John... You're not
being John, you're being yourself.

535
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,060
Well, absolutely no one should have
been able to empty

536
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,260
that bank account other than myself
and Helen.

537
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,420
Why didn't you assume it was your wife?
Because I've always had total faith in her.

538
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,620
No, it's because YOU emptied it.
Weight-loss, hair dye, Botox, affair.

539
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,740
Lawyer. Next!

540
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,580
This is Mr Blake. Piles.

541
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,860
Mr Blake, hi.

542
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,300
And your pen-pal's emails
just stopped, did they?

543
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,340
And you really thought
he was the one, didn't you?

544
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,820
The love of your life?

545
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,540
Stepfather posing as on-line
boyfriend.

546
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,700
What?

547
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,100
Breaks it off, breaks her heart.

548
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,380
She swears off relationships,
stays at home.

549
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,980
He still has her wage coming in.

550
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,820
Mr Windibank, you have been
a complete and utter...

551
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,220
Piss pot.

552
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,420
It's nothing to worry about, just a
small infection, by the sound of it.

553
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,100
Dr Verner is your usual GP, yes?

554
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He looked after me man and boy.

555
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,220
I run a little shop
just on the corner of Church Street.

556
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,900
Oh. Magazines and DVDs.

557
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,700
I've brought along a few little
beauties that might interest you...

558
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,340
Tree Worshippers. Oh, that's
a corker. It's very saucy.

559
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,660
And British Birds.
Same sort of thing.

560
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,860
I'm fine, thanks.

561
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,180
The Holy War.

562
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,740
Sounds a bit dry, I know,

563
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,060
but there's a nun with all these
holes in her habit...

564
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,580
Jesus! Sherlock.

565
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
What? What do you want?

566
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,820
Uh?

567
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,340
Have you come to torment me? What are you talking about?
"What are you talking...?"

568
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,940
What, do you think I'm going
to be fooled by this bloody beard?!

569
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,140
You're crazy! No, no, no, no, no.

570
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,940
It's not as good as your French!
Not as good as your French.

571
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,780
It's not even a good disguise,
Sherlock!

572
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,540
Where did you get it from,
a bloody joke shop...?!

573
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,940
Oh, my God!

574
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,460
I, I am so sorry.

575
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,060
Oh, my God!

576
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,220
Please...

577
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,580
It's fine.

578
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,860
This one's got us all baffled.

579
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,420
Hmm, I don't doubt it.

580
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,100
What is it?

581
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,540
You're onto something, aren't you?

582
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,780
Maybe.

583
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,380
'Show off!'

584
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,700
Shut up, John.
What? Hmm?

585
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,340
Nothing.

586
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,500
Hello. Hmm.

587
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Are you sure? I'm sure. OK.

588
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,620
I'm late for Cath.
I'll see you later.

589
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,460
Bye. Bye.

590
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,700
This going to be
your new arrangement, is it?

591
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,540
Just giving it a go.

592
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,380
Right.

593
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,820
So, John?

594
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,980
Not really in the picture any more.

595
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,860
Trains?

596
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,380
Trains.

597
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,100
Male, 40 to 50.
Oh, sorry, did you want to be...?

598
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,020
Er, no, please, be my guest.

599
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,180
'You jealous?'

600
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,380
Shut up!

601
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,820
It doesn't make sense.

602
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,900
What doesn't?

603
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,100
This skeleton,
it can't be any more than...

604
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,020
Six months old.

605
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,140
Wow!

606
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,540
"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper."

607
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,820
Uh-huh. That's impossible.
Welcome to my world.

608
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,700
'Smart arse!'

609
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,740
I won't insult your intelligence
by explaining it to you.

610
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,300
No, please, insult away.

611
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,940
'You forgot to put your collar up.'

612
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,020
The corpse is, is six months old.

613
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,100
It's dressed in a shoddy Victorian
outfit from a museum.

614
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,220
It's been displayed on a dummy
for many years,

615
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,580
in a case facing south-east, judging
from the fading of the fabric.

616
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,860
It was sold off in a fire damage sale
a week ago.

617
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,020
So the whole thing was a fake?

618
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,260
Yes.

619
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,060
Looked so promising.

620
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,100
Facile.

621
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Why would someone go to all
that trouble?

622
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,420
Why indeed, John?

623
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,700
'Mind the gap.
Mind the gap.'

624
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,620
Oh. Thanks for hanging onto it.

625
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,820
No problem.

626
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,420
So, what's this all about,
Mr Shilcott?

627
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,380
My girlfriend's a big fan of yours.

628
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,580
Girlfriend?!

629
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,180
Sorry. Do go on.

630
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,020
I like trains.

631
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,700
Yes... I work on the Tube, on the
District Line, and part of my job

632
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,300
is to wipe the security footage
after it's been cleared.

633
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,220
I was just whizzing through
and I found something a bit bizarre.

634
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,700
Now, this was a week ago.

635
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,300
The last train on the Friday night,
Westminster Station.

636
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,580
Now, this man gets into
the last car.

637
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,660
Car? They're cars, not carriages.

638
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,500
It's a legacy of the early American
involvement in the Tube system.

639
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,940
He said he liked trains.

640
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,620
And the next stop,
St James' Park Station.

641
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,100
And...

642
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,900
I thought you'd like it.

643
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,020
He gets into the last car
at Westminster. The only passenger.

644
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,620
And the car is empty
at St James's Park Station.

645
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,620
Explain that, Mr Holmes.

646
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,260
Couldn't he have just jumped off? There's a
safety mechanism that prevents the doors

647
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,740
from opening in transit.
But there's something else,

648
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,020
the driver of that train
hasn't been to work since.

649
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,100
According to his flatmate, he's
on holiday. Came into some money.

650
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,500
Bought off?

651
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,140
Hmm?

652
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,020
So if the driver of the train
was in on it,

653
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,540
then the passenger did get off.

654
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,700
There's nowhere he could go. It's a straight run
on the District Line between the two stations.

655
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,220
There's no side tunnels,
no maintenance tunnels.

656
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,860
Nothing on any map. Nothing.

657
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,940
Train never stops
and a man vanishes.

658
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,540
Good, innit?

659
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,260
I know that face.

660
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,500
Excuse you(!)

661
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,540
The journey between those stations
usually takes five minutes

662
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,820
and that one took ten. Ten minutes to get
from Westminster to St James's Park.

663
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,140
I'll need maps, lots of maps.
Older maps, all the maps. Right.

664
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,100
Fancy some chips? What?

665
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,660
I know a fantastic fish shop
just off the Marylebone Road,

666
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,700
the owner always gives me
extra portions.

667
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,220
Did you get him off a murder charge?

668
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,860
No, I helped him
put up some shelves.

669
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,060
Sherlock? Hmm?

670
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,100
What was today about?
Saying thank you.

671
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,980
For what?

672
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,540
For everything you did for me.
It's OK. It's my pleasure.

673
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,140
No. I mean it.

674
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,580
I don't mean pleasure,
I mean I didn't mind.

675
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,340
I wanted to... Moriarty slipped up,
he made a mistake.

676
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,660
Because the one person he thought
didn't matter at all to me

677
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,020
was the one person
that mattered the most.

678
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,660
You made it all possible.

679
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,620
But you can't do this again,
can you?

680
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,460
I've had a lovely day.
I'd love to, I just, um...

681
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,820
Hmm, congratulations, by the way.

682
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,260
He's not from work.

683
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,700
We met through friends,
old-fashioned way.

684
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,860
He's nice, we've got a dog,
we, we go to the pub on weekends

685
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,740
and I've met his mum and dad
and his friends and all his family.

686
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,860
I've no idea why I'm telling
you any of this...

687
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,220
I hope you'll be very happy,
Molly Hooper.

688
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,460
You deserve it.

689
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,260
After all, not all the men you fall
for can turn out to be sociopaths.

690
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,860
No? No.

691
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,540
Maybe it's just my type.

692
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,900
Oh, Mrs Hudson, sorry, I think
someone's got John. John Watson?

693
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,140
Hang on, who are you?!

694
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,820
Oh, I'm his fiancee.

695
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,220
Oh. Mary?

696
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,900
What's wrong?

697
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,380
Someone sent me this.

698
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,380
At first I thought it was just
a Bible thing,

699
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,700
you know, spam, but it's not.

700
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,300
It's a skip code.

701
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,100
First word, then every third.

702
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,780
"Save John Watson."

703
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,780
Now!

704
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,100
Where are we going?

705
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,100
St James The Less, it's a church.
20 minutes by car.

706
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,700
Did you drive here? Er, yes.

707
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,620
It's too slow, it's too slow.

708
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,700
Watch out! What are we waiting for?!

709
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,980
This.

710
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,140
What does it mean?

711
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,460
What are they going to do to him?

712
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,780
I don't know!

713
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,900
Damn!

714
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,780
Oi! Oi!
You can't go down there!

715
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,900
No, it's not going to work,
with that.

716
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,260
I'll get something to help it along.
Yeah.

717
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,460
Help! Argh!

718
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,820
He doesn't like it, Daddy. Huh?

719
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,740
Guy Fawkes, he doesn't like it.

720
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,900
Stay back, Zoe. Back!

721
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,940
Now.

722
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,140
What does it mean?

723
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,060
Oh, my God!

724
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,220
Help!

725
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,460
Stand back!

726
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,460
Move! Move! Move!

727
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,740
Move! Move!

728
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,820
John! John!

729
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,220
John! John!

730
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,660
Get up, John!

731
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,380
John! John?!

732
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,620
Help!

733
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,220
John!

734
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,940
John! John!

735
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,820
Hey, John.

736
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,860
'Which wasn't the way
I'd put it at all. Silly woman.'

737
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,300
Anyway, it was then that
I first noticed it was missing.

738
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,140
I said, "Have you checked
down the back of the sofa?"

739
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,220
He's always losing things down the
back of the sofa, aren't you, dear?

740
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,340
Afraid so.

741
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,820
Oh, keys, small change, sweeties.

742
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,300
Especially his glasses. Glasses.

743
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,660
Blooming things. I said,
"Why don't you get a chain,

744
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,100
"wear them round your neck?"

745
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,940
And he says, "What,
like Larry Grayson!" Larry Grayson.

746
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,140
So did you find it eventually,
your lottery ticket?

747
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,300
Well, yes, thank goodness.

748
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,460
We caught the coach on time
after all.

749
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,460
We managed to see St Paul's,
the Tower,

750
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,100
but they weren't letting
anyone into Parliament.

751
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,700
Some big debate going on.

752
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,340
John? Sorry, you're busy.
No, no, no, they were just leaving.

753
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,820
No, oh, were we? Yes.
No, no, if you've got a case...

754
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,500
No, not a case. Yeah, go. We're here till
Saturday, remember. Yes, wonderful. Just get out!

755
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,700
Yes, well, give us a ring.
Very nice, yes, good. Get out!

756
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,700
I can't tell you how glad
we are, Sherlock.

757
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,820
All that time people
thinking the worst.

758
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,740
We're just so pleased it's all over.

759
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,380
Ring up more often, won't you?

760
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,460
Mm-hm. She worries.

761
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,660
Promise?

762
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,100
Promise.

763
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,260
Oh, for God...

764
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,100
Sorry about that. No, it's fine.

765
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,260
Clients?

766
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,180
Just my parents.

767
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,220
Your parents?
In town for a few days.

768
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,020
Your parents? Mycroft promised to
take them to a matinee of Les Mis.

769
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,780
Tried to talk me into doing it.

770
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,180
Those were your parents? Yes.

771
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,540
Well...

772
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,980
..that is not what I...

773
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,780
What?

774
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,900
I mean, they're just so...

775
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,420
..ordinary.

776
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,900
It's a cross I have to bear.

777
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,900
Did they know too?

778
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,980
Hmm? That you spent the last
two years playing hide and seek?

779
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,980
Maybe. Ah, so that's why
they weren't at the funeral!

780
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Sorry, sorry again. Hmm.

781
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,860
Sorry.

782
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,340
So you've shaved it off then?

783
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,740
Yeah. Wasn't working for me.

784
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,820
Yeah, I'm glad. You didn't like it?

785
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,620
No, I prefer my doctors
clean-shaven.

786
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,940
That's not a sentence
you hear every day.

787
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,900
How are you feeling?

788
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,460
Yeah, not bad. Bit smoked.

789
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,540
Right.

790
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,340
Last night, who did that?

791
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,580
And why did they target me?

792
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,860
I don't know.

793
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,740
Is it someone trying
to get to you through me?

794
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,540
Is it something to do with this
terrorist thing you talked about?

795
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,340
I don't know, I can't see
the pattern. It's too nebulous.

796
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,820
Why would an agent give his life to tell us something
incredibly insignificant? That's what's strange.

797
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,540
Give his life?
According to Mycroft.

798
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,820
There's an underground network planning
an attack on London, that's all we know.

799
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,020
These are my rats, John. Rats?

800
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,860
My markers, agents, lowlifes.
People who might find themselves

801
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,540
arrested or their diplomatic
immunity suddenly rescinded.

802
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,380
If one of them starts acting
suspiciously, we know something's up.

803
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,980
Five of them are behaving perfectly
normally, but the sixth...

804
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,100
I know him, don't I?

805
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,260
Lord Moran, Peer of the Realm.
Minister for Overseas Development.

806
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,780
Pillar of the Establishment. Yes.

807
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,900
He's been working for North Korea
since 1996.

808
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,820
What? He's the big rat,
rat number one.

809
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,660
He's just done something
very suspicious indeed.

810
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,980
Yeah, that's odd.

811
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,780
There's nowhere
he could have got off?

812
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,940
Not according to the maps.

813
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,380
There's something, something,
something I'm missing.

814
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,420
Something staring me in the face.

815
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,500
Any idea who they are,
this underground network?

816
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,860
Intelligence must have a list
of the most obvious ones.

817
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,420
Our rat's just come out of his den.

818
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,620
Al-Qaeda? The IRA have been getting
restless again,

819
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,620
maybe they're going to make an
appearance... Yes, yes, yes, yes!

820
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,140
I've been an idiot, a blind idiot!

821
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,540
What? Oh, that's good.
That could be brilliant!

822
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,860
What are you on about? Mycroft's
intelligence is not nebulous at all,

823
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,580
it's specific, incredibly specific.

824
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,860
What do you mean?

825
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,620
It's not an underground network,
John, it's an Underground network!

826
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,460
Right.

827
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,060
What? Sometimes a deception
is so audacious, so outrageous

828
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,260
that you can't see it even when
it's staring you in the face. Look,

829
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,380
seven carriages
leave Westminster. Mm.

830
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,260
And only six carriages
arrive at St James's Park.

831
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,380
Ah, but that's, I mean,
it's impossible.

832
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,580
Moran didn't disappear.
The entire tube compartment did.

833
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,820
The driver must have diverted the train
and then detached the last carriage.

834
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,660
Detached it where? You said there
was nothing between those stations.

835
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,940
Not on the maps, but once
you eliminate the other factors,

836
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,500
the remaining thing must be the truth. That
carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.

837
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,020
But why, though?

838
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,580
Why detach it in the first place?

839
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,540
It vanishes between St James's Park
and Westminster.

840
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,260
Lord Moran vanishes.

841
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,260
You're kidnapped and nearly burnt
to death at a fireworks party.

842
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,380
What's the date, John, today's date?

843
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,900
Hmm? November the...

844
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,020
Oh, God!

845
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,700
Lord Moran,
he's a Peer of the Realm.

846
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,020
Normally he'd sit in the House.

847
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,900
Tonight, there's an all-night sitting
to vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.

848
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,500
But he won't be there, not tonight.

849
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Not the 5th November.

850
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,220
"Remember, remember..."

851
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,940
"Gunpowder, treason and plot!"

852
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,540
'There's nothing down there,
Mr Holmes, I told you.

853
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,180
'No sidings, no ghost stations.'

854
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,620
There has to be, check again.

855
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,900
This whole area is a big mess
of old and new stuff.

856
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,180
Charing Cross is made up
of bits of older stations,

857
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,700
like Trafalgar Square, Strand.

858
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,900
No, it's none of those,
we've accounted for those.

859
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,020
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street,
Sumatra Road, Parliament Street...

860
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,100
'Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road?

861
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,540
'You mentioned Sumatra Road,
Mr Holmes? There is something,

862
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,060
'I knew it rang a bell! Yes.

863
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,620
'There was a station down there.'

864
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,380
Well, why isn't it on the maps?

865
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,900
'Because it was closed
before it ever opened.' What?

866
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,380
'They built the platforms, even the
staircases, but it all got tied up

867
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,540
'in legal disputes and so they never
built the station on the surface.'

868
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,820
It's right underneath
the Palace of Westminster.

869
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,540
So what's down there, a bomb?

870
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,980
Oh.

871
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,180
'With many commentators saying

872
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,860
'the vote on the Terrorism Bill
will be too close to call,

873
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,900
'MPs are now making their way
into the Chamber for what

874
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,660
'the Government is calling "the most
important vote of this Parliament."

875
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,900
'Over now to our...'

876
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,940
'What freedoms
exactly are we protecting

877
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,100
'if we start spying on our
own people?

878
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,900
'This is a Orwellian measure
on a scale unprecedented...'

879
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,900
There's a bomb, then? The tube
carriage is carrying a bomb.

880
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,620
Must be. Right.

881
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,220
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police. What? No!

882
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,980
Sherlock, this isn't a game,
they need to evacuate Parliament.

883
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:53,300
They'll get in the way, they always
do. This is cleaner, more efficient.

884
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,420
And illegal?
A bit.

885
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,820
What are you doing?

886
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,100
Coming.

887
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,620
I don't understand.
Well, that's a first.

888
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,540
There's nowhere else it could be.

889
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,420
Oh!

890
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,060
What?!

891
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:53,700
Hang on, Sherlock...?
What? That's, isn't it live?

892
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,460
Perfectly safe as long as we avoid
touching the rails.

893
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,260
Of course, yeah,
avoid the rails. Great!

894
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,620
This way.

895
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,140
Are you sure? Sure.

896
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,820
Ha!

897
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,140
Look at that.

898
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,220
John... Hmm?

899
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,420
Demolition charges.

900
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,940
It's empty. There's nothing.

901
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,060
Isn't there?

902
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,740
This is the bomb.

903
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,020
What?

904
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,340
It's not carrying explosives,
the whole compartment is the bomb.

905
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,100
We need bomb disposal.

906
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,780
There may not be time for that now.

907
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,940
So what do we do?

908
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,180
I have no idea.

909
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,580
Well, think of something.
Why do you think I know what to do?

910
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,180
Cos you're Sherlock Holmes,
you're as clever as it gets.

911
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,300
It doesn't mean I know how
to defuse a giant bomb!

912
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,260
What about you?! I wasn't in bomb
disposal, I'm a bloody doctor!

913
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,300
And a soldier,
as you keep reminding us all!

914
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,580
Can't... Can't we rip
the timer off, or something?

915
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,380
That would set it off.
You see, you know things!

916
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,340
Oh!

917
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,020
Er... My God!

918
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,660
Er...

919
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,060
Why didn't you call the police?!

920
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,260
Can you just...? Why do you
never call the police?!

921
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,380
Well, it's no use now.

922
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,020
So you can't switch the bomb off?!

923
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,620
You can't switch the bomb off
and you didn't call the police!

924
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,740
Go, John. Go now!

925
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:13,620
There's no point now, is there,
because there's not enough time

926
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,180
to get away and if we don't do this,
other people will die!

927
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,900
Mind palace!

928
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,740
Hmm? Use your mind palace!

929
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,940
How will that help?

930
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,900
You've salted away
every fact under the sun!

931
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,580
And you think I've just got "how to defuse a
bomb" tucked away in there somewhere?! Yes!

932
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,740
Maybe.

933
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,540
Think!

934
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,100
Think, please think.

935
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,540
Think!

936
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,740
I can't!

937
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,060
Oh, my God!

938
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,340
This is it.

939
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,740
Um, er...

940
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,740
Oh, my God!

941
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,820
Turn that off. Oh, God!

942
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,220
Er, um, er...

943
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,100
I'm sorry.

944
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,420
What?

945
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,380
I can't, I can't do it, John.

946
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,540
I don't know how.

947
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,220
Forgive me.

948
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,500
What?!

949
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,220
Please, John, forgive me,

950
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,540
for all the hurt that I caused you.

951
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,460
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this is a trick. No.

952
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,020
Another one of your bloody tricks.

953
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,420
No. You're just trying
to make me say something nice.

954
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,900
Not this time.

955
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,060
It's just to make you look good
even though you've behaved like...

956
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,780
I wanted you not to be dead.

957
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,780
Yeah, well, be careful
what you wish for.

958
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,580
If I hadn't come back,
you wouldn't be standing there and...

959
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,260
..you'd still have a future,
with Mary.

960
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,180
Yeah, I know.

961
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:33,580
Look, I find it difficult. I find
it difficult, this sort of stuff.

962
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,900
I know.

963
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:42,220
You were the best and the wisest man
that I have ever known.

964
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,220
Yes, of course I forgive you.

965
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,540
The criminal network Moriarty
headed was vast.

966
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,740
Its roots were everywhere, like a
cancer, so we came up with a plan.

967
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,900
Mycroft fed Moriarty
information about me.

968
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,620
Moriarty, in turn, gave us hints,

969
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,140
just hints as to the extent
of his web.

970
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,100
We let him go, because it was
important to let him believe

971
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,660
he had the upper hand.

972
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,460
And then, I sat back
and watched Moriarty

973
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:30,100
destroy my reputation, bit by bit.

974
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,140
I had to make him
believe he'd beaten me,

975
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,900
utterly defeated me,
and then he'd show his hand.

976
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,780
There were 13 likely scenarios
once we were up on that roof.

977
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,460
Each of them were rigorously worked
out and given a code name.

978
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,220
It wasn't just my reputation
that Moriarty needed to bury.

979
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,740
I had to die.

980
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,540
Sherlock!

981
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,900
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

982
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,020
you can do anything you like
with me,

983
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,660
but nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

984
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:03,660
Your only three friends
in the world will die, unless...

985
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,540
Unless I kill myself
and complete your story.

986
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:10,460
You've got to admit that's sexier.

987
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:13,100
'But the one thing I didn't
anticipate was just how far

988
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,940
'Moriarty was prepared to go.
I suppose that was obvious,

989
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,380
'given our first meeting
at the swimming pool.

990
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,580
'His death wish.'

991
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,700
Argh!

992
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,820
'I knew I didn't have long.

993
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,660
'I contacted my brother,
set the wheels in motion.

994
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,820
'And then everyone got to work.'

995
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,540
'It's a trick.'

996
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,380
'It's just a magic trick.'

997
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,580
'All right, stop it now.'

998
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,500
'Now, stay exactly where you are.'

999
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,460
'Don't move!'

1000
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,020
All right.

1001
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,300
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1002
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,140
Please, will you do this for me?

1003
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:52,100
'It was vital that John stayed
just where I'd put him

1004
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,820
'and that way his view was blocked
by the ambulance station.'

1005
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,380
Sherlock!

1006
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,300
'I needed to hit the air-bag,

1007
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,220
'which I did.

1008
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,900
'Speed was paramount.

1009

'That's where Molly came in.

1013
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,460
'Like figures on a weather clock, we
went one way, John went the other.

1014
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,700

1015

1017
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,660

1018
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:00,740
'And one final touch,
a squash ball under the armpit.

1019
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,220
'Apply enough pressure and it
momentarily cuts off the pulse.'

1020
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,180
Let me come through, please!

1021
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,740
It's all right...
No, he's my friend.

1022
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,020
It's all right.
No, he's my friend.

1023
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,580
It's all right, it's all right...
He's my friend, please.

1024
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,580
Everything was anticipated,
every eventuality allowed for.

1025
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,260
It worked perfectly.

1026
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,260
Molly. Molly Hooper?
She was in on it?

1027
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,100
Yes. You remember the little girl
who was abducted by Moriarty?

1028
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,380
Get out!

1029
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,220
'You assumed she reacted like that
because I was her kidnapper.'

1030
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,740
But I deduced Moriarty must have
found someone who looked

1031
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,380
very like me to plant suspicion,
and that that man, whoever he was,

1032
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,380
had to be got out of the way
as soon as his usefulness ended.

1033
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,660
That meant there was a corpse
in the morgue somewhere

1034
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,820
that looked just like me.

1035
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,100
Clever.

1036
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,940
Molly found the body,
faked the records

1037
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,420
and I provided the other coat.

1038
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,940
I've got lots of coats.

1039
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,740
What about the sniper
aiming at John?

1040
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,300
Mycroft's men intervened before
he could take the shot.

1041
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,820
He was invited to reconsider.

1042
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,860
Is it done?

1043
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,700
Good.

1044
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,100
And your homeless network?

1045
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,500
As I explained,
the whole street was closed off.

1046
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,500
Like a scene from a play.

1047
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,260
Neat, don't you think?

1048
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,940
Hmm...

1049
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,540
What?

1050
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,100
Not the way I'd have done it.

1051
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,460
Oh, really?

1052
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,620
No, I'm not saying
it's not clever, but... What?

1053
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,580
Bit...disappointed.

1054
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,460
Oh. Everyone's a critic.
Anyway, that's not why I came.

1055
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,180
No? No, I think you know
why I'm here, Phillip.

1056
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:58,060
"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper?"

1057
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Didn't you think it was intriguing?

1058
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,740
Lurid. A case so sensational
you hoped I'd be interested.

1059
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:09,540
But you overdid it, Phillip.
You and your little fan-club.

1060
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,460
I just couldn't live with myself,
knowing that I'd driven you to...

1061
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,660
But you didn't. You were
always right, I wasn't dead.

1062
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:21,660
No. No, and everything's OK now,
isn't it?

1063
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1064
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,540
Though of course you've
wasted police time.

1065
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,460
Perverted the course of justice.

1066
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,300
Risked distracting me from a massive
terrorist assault that could have

1067
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,180
both destroyed Parliament and caused
the death of hundreds of people.

1068
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,140
Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm sorry,
Sherlock!

1069
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,940
I'm so sorry.

1070
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,980
Hang on.

1071
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,060
That doesn't make sense.

1072
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,460
How could you be sure John
would stand on that exact spot?

1073
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,820
I mean, what if he'd moved?

1074
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,660
And...how did you
do it all so quickly?

1075
01:18:58,660 --> 01:18:59,940
What if the bike hadn't hit him?

1076
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,220
And anyway,
why are you telling me all this?

1077
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:08,260
If you'd pulled that off, I'm the
last person you'd tell the truth to!

1078
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:16,500
Sherlock Holmes!

1079
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,940
You...
Oh, your face!

1080
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,300
..utter... Your face!

1081
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,460
You!

1082
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,580
Totally had you!
You cock!

1083
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,100
I knew it! I knew it! You... Oh, those
things you said, such sweet things.

1084
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,580
I never knew you cared. I will, I'll kill
you if you ever breathe a word of this...

1085
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,220
Scout's honour.
..to anyone! You knew!

1086
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,900
You knew how to turn it off!

1087
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,300
There's an off switch.

1088
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,300
There's always an off switch.

1089
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,580
Terrorists can get into
all sorts of problems

1090
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,140
unless there's an off switch.

1091
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:33,860
So why did you let me go through
all that?! I didn't lie altogether.

1092
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,380
I've absolutely no idea how to turn
any of these silly little lights off.

1093
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,580
And you did call the police?
Of course I called the police.

1094
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,460
I'm definitely going to kill you!

1095
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:50,220
Oh, please. Killing me,
that's so two years ago.

1096
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,700
'Sherlock, please,
I beg of you.

1097
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,300
'You can take over at the interval.'

1098
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,660
Oh, I'm sorry, brother dear,
but you made a promise.

1099
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,420
Nothing I can do to help.

1100
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,260
'But you don't understand
the pain of it, the horror.'

1101
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:45,220
Come on, you'll have to go down,
they want the story.

1102
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,340
In a minute.

1103
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,580
I'm really pleased, Mary.
Have you set a date?

1104
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,060
Well, we thought May.
Ah, a spring wedding. Yeah.

1105
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,940
Well, once we've
actually got engaged. Yeah.

1106
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:01,380
We were interrupted last time.
Yeah. Well, I can't wait.

1107
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,500
You will be there, Sherlock?

1108
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
Weddings, not really my thing.

1109
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,580
Hello, everyone. Hello, Molly.

1110
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:10,700
This is Tom.
Tom, this is everyone. Hi.

1111
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,100
Hi. It's really nice
to meet you all. Hi.

1112
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,100
Wow! Yeah, hi, I'm John,
good to meet you.

1113
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,220
Ready?
Ready.

1114
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,540
Champagne?

1115
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,300
Yes.

1116
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:34,500
Thanks.

1117
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,780
Thank you.

1118
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,580
Sit down, love. Oh, thanks.

1119
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,780
So um...

1120
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,940
Is it serious, you two?

1121
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,460
Yeah. I've moved on.

1122
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:51,300
Did you...?

1123
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,620
I'm not saying a word. No, best not.

1124
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,100
But I'm still waiting. Hmm?

1125
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,300
Why did they try and kill me?

1126
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,980
If they knew you were onto them,
why come after me?

1127
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,660
Put me in a bonfire?

1128
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,940
I don't know.
I don't like not knowing.

1129
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,460
Unlike the nicely embellished
fictions on your blog, John,

1130
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,540
real life is rarely so neat.

1131
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,140
I don't know who was behind
all this, but I will find out,

1132
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,620
I promise you.

1133
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,380
Don't pretend
you're not enjoying this.

1134
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,100
Hmm?
Being back. Being a hero again.

1135
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,620
Don't be stupid. You'd have
to be an idiot not to see it.

1136
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,940
You love it. Love what?

1137
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,620
Being Sherlock Holmes.

1138
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,580
I don't even know what
that's supposed to mean.

1139
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:39,140
Sherlock, you are going to tell me
how you did it?

1140
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,020
How you jumped off
that building and survived?

1141
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,580
You know my methods, John,
I am known to be indestructible.

1142
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:49,020
No, but seriously.

1143
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,740
When you were dead,
I went to your grave.

1144
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,220
I should hope so.

1145
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,580
I made a little speech.

1146
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,660
I actually spoke to you.

1147
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,460
I know. I was there.

1148
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,380
I asked you for one more miracle.

1149
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,540
I asked you to stop being dead.

1150
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,300
I heard you.

1151
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,900
Anyway, time to go
and be Sherlock Holmes.

1152
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,140
'John!'

1153
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,260
'John!'

1154
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,220
'John!

1155
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,780
'John!

1156
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,580
'John!'
