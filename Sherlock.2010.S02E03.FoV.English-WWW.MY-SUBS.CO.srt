1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,559
THUNDER RUMBLES

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,840
Why today?

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,499
Do you want to hear me say it?
18 months since our last appointment.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,780
You read the papers?

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,339
Sometimes...

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,820
And you watch telly?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,540
You know why I'm here.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,820
I'm here because...

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,300
What happened, John?

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,980
Sherl...

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,740
You need to get it out.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,259
My best friend...

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,660
Sherlock Holmes...

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,420
is dead.

15
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,979
Falls Of The Reichenbach.
Turner's masterpiece.

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,739
Thankfully recovered,

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,699
owing to the prodigious talent
of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,420
APPLAUSE

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
A small token of our gratitude.

20
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,539
Diamond cufflinks...
All my cuffs have buttons.

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,860
He means thank you. Do I?

22
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:01,699
Just say it. Thank you.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,140
Hang on.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,499
Back together with my family,
after my terrifying ordeal.

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,779
And we have one person to thank
for my deliverance...

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,939
Sherlock Holmes.

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,820
APPLAUSE

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,180
Tie pin. I don't wear ties. Shhh.

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,299
Peter Ricoletti... Number one on
Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,480
We got him, and there's
one person we have

31
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,659
to thank for giving us
the decisive leads.

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,299
With all his customary diplomacy
and tact.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Sarcasm. Yes.

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,460
We all chipped in.

35
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,779
Oh...

36
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,419
Put the hat on. Put the hat on.

37
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,699
Yes, Sherlock, put it on.

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,060
Just get it over with.

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,899
"Boffin!"

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,459
"Boffin Sherlock Holmes!"

41
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,738
Everybody gets one.

44
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:23,059
Page five, column six,
first sentence.

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,099
Why is it always the hat
photograph?!

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,940
"Bachelor John Watson.
" What kind of hat is it?

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,779
What are they implying?!

48
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,779
Is it a cap? Why has it
got two fronts? It's a deerstalker.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,100
"Frequently seen in the company
of bachelor John Watson.

50
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,419
" What are you going
to do, throw it?

51
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,099
"Confirmed bachelor John Watson."
A death frisbee! This is too much,

52
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,480
we need to be more careful.
It's got flaps.

53
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,859
Ear flaps, it's
an ear hat, John.

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,659
What do you mean, more careful?

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,899
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker
now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,739
I mean, you're not exactly
a private detective any more.

57
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,939
You're this far from famous.
Oh, it'll pass.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,640
It better pass.
The press will turn, Sherlock,

59
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:03,339
they always turn and
they'll turn on you.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,139
It really bothers you.
What? What people say. Yes.

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,260
About me? why would it upset YOU?

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,540
Just try to keep a low profile. Find
yourself a little case this week.

63
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,780
Stay out of the news.

64
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,139
MOBILE BLEEPS

65
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,859
That's your phone.

66
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,100
Hmm, it keeps doing that.

67
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,579
So, did you just talk to him
for a really long time?

68
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,699
Oh, Henry Fishguard
never committed suicide.

69
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,179
Bow Street runners
missed everything.

70
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,699
Pressing case, is it? They're all
pressing until they're solved.

71
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Put your key back please.
Thank you.

72
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,179
Excuse me, sir.

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,940
Any metal objects, keys,
mobile phones?

74
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,779
You can go through.

75
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,980
Thank you.

76
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,420
Fancy a cuppa then, mate?

77
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,900
Yeah, why not?

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,939
Gilts at seven.

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,860
Dutch Telecoms in free-fall.
Thank you, Harvey.

80
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,020
What are you saying?

81
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,899
Refuse them all parole
and bring back the rope?

82
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,500
Let's begin.

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,219
ALARM SOUNDS

84
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,739
This is an emergency. Please leave.

Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

86
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,740
DOOR BANGS

87
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,099
Sir, there's been a break-in.

88
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,140
Not our division.

89
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,579
You'll want it.

Hacked into the Tower of bloody
London's security?! How?!

There's been another
one, another break-in.

Bank of England!

Sir! Security's down, sir.
It's failing.

99
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,740
What is it now?

100
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,499
Pentonville Prison.

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,220

James Moriarty, earlier today
accused of...

attempting to steal
the Crown Jewels.

There are two types of fans. Oh?

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,259
Catch me before I kill again,
Type A. Uh-huh.

152

What's Type B? Your bedroom's
just a taxi ride away. Hmm.

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,180
Guess which one I am?

154
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,179
Neither. Really?
No, you're not a fan at all.

155
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,499
Those marks on your forearm,
edge of a desk.

156
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,379
You've been typing in a hurry, probably,
pressure on, facing a deadline.

157
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,899
That all?

158
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,139
There's an ink smudge on your wrist,
a bulge in your jacket pocket.

159
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,280
Bit of a giveaway?
The smudge is deliberate,

160
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,419
to see if I'm as good
as they say I am.

161
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,699
Hmm. Oil-based,
used in newspaper print.

162
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,619
But drawn on with an index finger,
your finger. Hmm.

163
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,540
Journalist. Unlikely you
get your hands dirty at the press.

164
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,979
You put that there to test me.
Wow! I'm liking you.

165
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,499
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock
Holmes, the man beneath the hat".

166
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,219
Kitty...

167
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,619
Riley. Pleased to meet you.

168
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,060
I'm saving you the
job of asking.

169
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:06,499
I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.

170
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,700
You and John Watson,
just platonic?

171
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,899
Can I put you down for a
"no" there as well(?)

172
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,219
There's all sorts of gossip
in the press about you.

173
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,059
Sooner or later, you're going
to need someone on your side.

174
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,340
Someone to set the record straight.

175
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,299
You think you're
the girl for that job, do you?

176
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I'm smart and you can trust me...

177
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,859
totally.

178
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,579
Smart? OK, investigative
journalist.

179
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,700
Good. Well, look at me
and tell me what you see.

180
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,179
If you're that skilful,
you don't need an interview,

181
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,340
you can just read what you need.

182
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,779
No? OK, my turn.

183
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,940
I see someone who's
waiting for their first

184
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:56,099
scoop, so their editor
will notice them.

185
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,760
You're wearing an expensive
skirt, that's been

186
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:01,419
rehemmed twice.
Only posh skirt you've got.

187
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,340
Your nails, you can't afford
to do them that often.

188
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:05,259
I see someone who's hungry,

189
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,720
I don't see smart.
I don't see trustworthy.

190
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:10,180
I'll give you a quote.
if you like. Three little words.

191
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,260
You repel me.

192
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,419
"A consulting criminal." Yes.

193
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,860
Your words.
Can you expand on that answer?

194
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,339
James Moriarty is for hire.
A tradesman?

195
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,539
Yes. But not the sort
who'd fix your heating?

196
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,579
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb
or stage an assassination.

197
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,139
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job
of your boiler.

198
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,699
Would you describe him as...

199
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,179
Leading. What?
You're leading the witness.

200
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,659
He'll object and the judge'll
uphold. Mr Holmes.

201
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,460
Ask me how,
HOW would I describe him?

202
00:15:56,461 --> 00:16:00,219
What opinion have I formed of him?
Do they not teach you this?

203
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,419
Mr Holmes,
we are fine without your help.

204
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,379
HOW would you describe this man,
his character?

205
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,859
First mistake.

206
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,699
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

207
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,380
He's a spider.

208
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,339
A spider at the centre of a web, a
criminal web with a thousand threads

209
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,340
and he knows precisely how each
and every single one of them dances.

210
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,939
SHE CLEARS THROAT

211
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,259
And how long...?
No, no. Don't, don't do that.

212
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,979
That's really not a good question.
Mr Holmes!

213
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,779
How long have I known him?
Not your best line of enquiry.

214
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,019
We met twice, five minutes in total.

215
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,339
I pulled a gun,
he tried to blow me up.

216
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,499
I felt we had a special something.

217
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,939
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously
claiming this man is an expert?

218
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,979
After knowing the accused
for just five minutes?

219
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,019
Two minutes would have made me
an expert, five was ample.

220
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,180
Mr Holmes, that's a matter
for the jury. Oh, really?

221
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,339
One librarian, two teachers,

222
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,619
two high-pressure jobs,
probably the City.

223
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,960
The foreman's a medical
secretary, trained

224
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,299
abroad, judging by her shorthand.
Mr Holmes?

225
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,419
Seven are married, two are having
an affair with each other.

226
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,640
Oh, they've just had
tea and biscuits.

227
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,859
Would you like to know who ate the wafer?
Mr Holmes!

228
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,619
You've been called here
to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,

229
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,259
not to give us a display
of your intellectual prowess.

230
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,979
Keep your answers brief
and to the point.

231
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,139
Anything else
will be treated as contempt.

232
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,219
Do you think you could survive
for just a few minutes...

233
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,700
WITHOUT SHOWING OFF?!

234
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
CELL DOOR SLAMS

235
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,299
What did I say?
I said don't get clever.

236
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,379
I can't just turn it on and off
like a tap. Well? Well, what?

237
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,899
You were there for the whole thing,
up in the gallery, start to finish.

238
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,499
Like you said it would be... sat
on his backside, never even stirred.

239
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,659
Moriarty is not mounting
any defence.

240
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,579
Bank of England, Tower of London,
Pentonville.

241
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,179
Three of the most secure places
in the country

242
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,259
and six weeks ago,
Moriarty breaks in,

243
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,979
no-one knows how or why.

244
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,780
All we know is...
He ended up in custody.

245
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,859
Don't do that. Do what?

246
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,040
The look. Look?
You're doing the look again.

247
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,219
Well, I can't see it, can I?

248
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,699
It's my face.

249
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,299
Yes and you're doing a "We both know
what's really going on here" face.

250
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,379
We do. No, I don't, which is why
I find the face so annoying.

251
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,739
If Moriarty wanted the jewels,
he'd have them.

252
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,659
If he wanted the prisoners freed,
they'd be on the streets.

253
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,299
The reason he's still in a prison
cell is because he chose to be there.

254
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,100
Somehow this is part of his scheme.

255
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,580
Mr Crayhill,
can we have your first witness?

256
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,979
Your Honour,
we're not calling any witnesses.

257
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,499
I don't follow.

258
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,979
You've entered a plea
of not guilty.

259
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,859
Nevertheless,
my client is offering no evidence.

260
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,620
The defence... rests.

261
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,499
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
James Moriarty stands accused...

262
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,980
of several counts
of attempted burglary.

263
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,659
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

264
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,579
will elicit a very long
custodial sentence,

265
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,299
and yet... his legal team...

266
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,059
has chosen to offer
no evidence whatsoever

267
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,139
to support their plea.

268
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,739
I find myself
in the unusual position

269
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,859
of recommending a verdict
wholeheartedly.

270
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,780
You must find him guilty.

271
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,259
Guilty.

272
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,180
You must find him guilty.

273
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,939
DOOR SLAMS

274
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,299
They're coming back.
That's six minutes.

275
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,259
Surprised it took them
that long, to be honest.

276
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,340
There's a queue for the loo!

277
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,220
Have you reached a verdict
on which you all agree?

278
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,140
PHONE RINGS

279
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,179
Not guilty,
they found him not guilty.

280
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,180
No defence
and Moriarty's walked free.

281
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,499
Sherlock?

282
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,140
Are you listening? He's out, you know
he'll be coming after you. Sherl...

283
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,260
VIOLIN PLAYS

284
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,579
STAIRS CREAK

285
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,500
MUSIC STOPS

286
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,300
VIOLIN PLAYS AGAIN

287
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,380
DOOR CREAKS

288
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,780
Most people knock.

289
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,700
But then, you're not most people,
I suppose.

290
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,860
Kettle's just boiled.

291
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,540
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.

292
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,700
May I? Please.

293
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,299
You know when he was
on his deathbed, Bach,

294
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,179
he heard his son at the piano
playing one of his... pieces.

295
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,059
The boy stopped
before he got to the end.

296
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,219
The dying man jumped out of bed,
ran to the piano and finished it.

297
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,539
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.
Neither can you, that's why you've come.

298
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,619
Be honest, you're a tiny bit
pleased. What, with the verdict?

299
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,860
With me, back on the streets.

300
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,860
Every fairy tale needs
a good old-fashioned villain.

301
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,020
You need me or you're nothing.

302
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,859
Because we're just alike, you and I,

303
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,380
except you're boring.

304
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,739
You're on the side of the angels.

305
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,580
You got to the jury, of course.

306
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,819
I got into the Tower of London,

307
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,220
you think I can't worm my way
into 12 hotel rooms?

308
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,419
Cable network.

309
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,660
Every hotel bedroom
has a personalised TV screen.

310
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,859
And every person
has their pressure point.

311
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,140
Someone that they want
to protect from harm.

312
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,459
Easy peasy.

313
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
So how are you going to do it?

314
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,659
Burn me?

315
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,940
Ah, that's the problem,
the final problem.

316
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,420
Have you worked out what it is yet?

317
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,339
What's the final problem?

318
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,100
I did tell you...
but did you listen?

319
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,900
How hard do you find it,
having to say "I don't know"?

320
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,179
I don't know. Oh, that's clever,
very clever, awfully clever.

321
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,859
Speaking of clever, have you
told your little friends yet?

322
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,100
Told them what?

323
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:05,139
Why I broke into all those places
and never took anything? No.

324
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,179
But you understand? Obviously.
Off you go, then.

325
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,419
Tell you what you already know?
No, prove that you know it.

326
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,699
You didn't take anything
because you don't need to. Good.

327
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,179
You'll never need to take anything
ever again. Very good, because?

328
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,459
Because nothing
in the Bank of England,

329
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,859
the Tower of London or Pentonville
Prison could possibly match

330
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,539
the value of the key
that could get you into all three.

331
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,579
I can open any door anywhere with
a few tiny lines of computer code.

332
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,899
No such thing as a private bank
account now, they're all mine.

333
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,060
No such thing as secrecy,
I OWN secrecy.

334
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,219
Nuclear codes?

335
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,739
I could blow up NATO
in alphabetical order.

336
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,859
In a world of locked rooms,
the man with the key is king.

337
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,940
And honey,
you should see me in a crown.

338
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,259
You were advertising
all through the trial,

339
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,459
you were showing the world
what you can do.

340
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,939
And you were helping.

341
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,739
Big client list... rogue governments,
intelligence communities,

342
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,380
terrorist cells.

343
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,339
They all want me.

344
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,539
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.

345
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,339
If you can break any bank, what do
you care about the highest bidder?

346
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,179
I don't, I just like to watch them
all competing.

347
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,979
"Daddy loves me the best."
Aren't ordinary people adorable?

348
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,459
Well, you know, you've got John.
I should get myself a live-in one.

349
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,179
Why are you doing all of this?
It must be so funny.

350
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,619
You don't want money or power,
not really.

351
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,019
What is it all for?

352
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,740
I want to solve the problem.

353
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,459
Our problem.

354
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,940
The final problem.

355
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,179
It's going to start
very soon, Sherlock... the fall.

356
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,779
HE WHISTLES

357
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,619
But don't be scared,
falling is just like flying,

358
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,340
except there's a more
permanent destination.

359
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,540
Never liked riddles.

360
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,500
Learn to.

361
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,060
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

362
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,420
I... owe... you.

363
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,980
KEYPAD BLEEPS

364
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,620
Er, excuse me,
I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?

365
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,859
Would you happen to know
if he's around at all?

366
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,299
Can you not hear me?

367
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,099
Yes, all right. Anyone?

368
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,419
Anyone at all know...

369
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,939
where Mycroft Holmes is,
I've been asked to meet him here?

370
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,899
No takers, right. Am I invisible,
can you actually see me?

371
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,459
Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to
meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?!

372
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,339
MUFFLED CRIES FROM JOHN

373
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,339
Tradition, John,
our traditions define us.

374
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,499
So total silence is traditional,
is it?

375
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,339
You can't even say pass the sugar?

376
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,499
Three-quarters
of the diplomatic service

377
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,819
and half the government front bench
all sharing one tea trolley,

378
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,499
it's for the best, believe me.

379
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,939
We don't want a repeat of... 1972.

380
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,739
But we can talk in here.
You read this stuff?

381
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,179
Caught my eye. Mm-hm.

382
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,499
Saturday,
they're doing a big expose.

383
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,299
I'd love to know
where she got her information.

384
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,259
Someone called Brook.
Recognise the name?

385
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,139
School friend, maybe?

386
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,740
HE LAUGHS
Of Sherlock's?

387
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,180
But that's not why I asked you here.

388
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,659
Who's that? Don't know? No.
Never seen his face before?

389
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,059
Um... He's taken a flat in Baker
Street, two doors down from you.

390
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,219
Hm, I was thinking of doing
a drinks thing for the neighbours.

391
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,779
I'm not sure you'll want to.

392
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,539
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad,
expertly trained killer,

393
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,139
living less than 20 feet
from your front door.

394
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,259
Well, it's a great location.
Jubilee line's handy.

395
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,579
John... What's it got to do with me?

396
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,619
Dyachenko. Ludmila.

397
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,020
Oh...

398
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,979
Actually, I think I have seen her.
Russian killer.

399
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,259
She's taken the flat opposite.

400
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,460
OK.

401
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,699
I'm sensing a pattern here.

402
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,459
In fact, four top
international assassins relocate

403
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,340
to within spitting distance of 221b.

404
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,539
Anything you'd care to share with me?
JOHN LAUGHS

405
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,219
I'm moving? It's not hard to guess
the common denominator, is it?

406
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,939
You think this is Moriarty?

407
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,539
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

408
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:07,020
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead
already. If not Moriarty, then who?

409
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,739
Why don't you talk to Sherlock,
if you're so concerned about him?

410
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,379
Oh, God, don't tell me.

411
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,259
Too much history between us, John.

412
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,459
Old scores, resentments.

413
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,020
Nicked all his Smurfs?
Broke his Action Man?

414
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,780
(Finished.)

415
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,179
We both know what's coming, John.

416
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,459
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn
to destroy his only rival.

417
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,400
So you want me to
watch out for your

418
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,339
brother because he won't
accept your help?

419
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,500
If it's not too much trouble?

420
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,700
DOOR BANGS

421
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,620
Excuse me. Sorry.

422
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,299
Sherlock, something weird... What's
going on? Kidnapping. Rufus Bruhl.

423
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,819
The ambassador to the US.
He's in Washington, isn't he?

424
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,899
Not him, his children. Max
and Claudette, age seven and nine.

425
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,739
They're at St Aldates.
Posh boarding place in Surrey.

426
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,779
School broke up,
the boarders went home.

427
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,740
A few kids remained,
including those two.

428
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,699
The kids have vanished.

429
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,340
The ambassador's asked for you
personally. The Reichenbach hero.

430
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,820
Isn't it great
to be working with a celebrity?

431
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,299
We shouldn't need to keep you
for much longer. Thank you.

432
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,779
It's all right. Miss Mackenzie,
House Mistress. Go easy.

433
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,419
Miss Mackenzie,
you're in charge of pupil welfare,

434
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,739
yet you left this place
wide open last night.

435
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,899
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or
a criminal?! Quickly, tell me!

436
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,619
All the doors and windows
were properly bolted.

437
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,259
No-one, not even me,
went into their room last night.

438
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,379
You have to believe me! I do,
I just wanted you to speak quickly.

439
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,860
Miss Mackenzie will need
to breath into a bag now.

440
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,380
SHE SOBS

441
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,099
Six grand a term, you'd expect them
to keep the kids safe for you.

442
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,859
You said the other kids
had all left on their holidays.

443
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,299
They were the only two
sleeping on this floor.

444
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,539
There's absolutely
no sign of a break-in.

445
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,060
The intruder must have been
hidden inside some place.

446
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,660
Show me where the brother slept.

447
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,380
The boy sleeps there every night.

448
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,219
Gazing at the only light source
outside in the corridor.

449
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,699
He'd recognise every shape,
every outline,

450
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,099
the silhouette of everyone
who came to the door.

451
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,099
OK, so? So if someone approaches
the door who he doesn't recognise,

452
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,980
an intruder, maybe he can even see
the outline of a weapon.

453
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,219
What would he do?

454
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,139
In the precious few seconds
before they came into the room,

455
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,619
how would he use them
if not to cry out?

456
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,499
This little boy,
this particular little boy,

457
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,979
who reads all of those spy books,
what would he do?

458
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,140
He'd leave a sign?

459
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:08,020
HE SNIFFS

460
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,020
Get Anderson!

461
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,620
Linseed oil.

462
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,499
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to
the kidnapper. Brilliant, Anderson.

463
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,300
Really? Yes, brilliant
impression of an idiot.

464
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,740
Floor.

465
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,659
He... made a trail for us. The boy
was made to walk ahead of them.

466
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,459
On what, tiptoe? Indicates anxiety.

467
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,900
Gun held to his head.

468
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,379
The girl was pulled beside him,
dragged sideways.

469
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,980
He had his left arm
cradled about her neck.

470
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,419
That's the end of it, we don't know
where they went from here.

471
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,619
Tells us nothing after all.

472
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,140
You're right, Anderson, nothing.

473
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,860
Except his shoe size, his height,
his gait, his walking pace.

474
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,340
SHERLOCK LAUGHS

475
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,860
Having fun? Starting to.

476
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,820
Maybe don't do the smiling.
Kidnapped children?

477
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,659
How could he get past the CCTV?
If all the doors were locked.

478
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,739
He walked in
when they weren't locked.

479
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,619
But a stranger can't just
walk into a school like that.

480
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,179
Anyone can walk in anywhere
if they pick the right moment.

481
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,659
Yesterday, end of term, parents
milling around, chauffeurs, staff.

482
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,700
What's one more stranger
among that lot?

483
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,820
He was waiting for them.

484
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,020
All he had to do
was find a place to hide.

485
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,139
Molly!

486
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,299
Hello, I'm just going out. No,
you're not. I've got a lunch date.

487
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,939
Cancel it, have lunch with me.
What? I need your help.

488
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,579
One of your old boyfriends,
we're tracking him down.

489
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,379
He's been naughty. Moriarty?
Of course it's Moriarty!

490
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,379
Jim wasn't my boyfriend,
we went out three times. I ended it.

491
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,860
Then he stole the Crown
Jewels, broke into the

492
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,339
Bank of England and
organised a prison break.

493
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,720
For the sake of law and
order, I suggest you avoid

494
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:27,100
all future attempts at
a relationship, Molly.

495
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,139
Oil, John. The oil
in the kidnapper's footprint.

496
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,019
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

497
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,739
All the chemical traces on his shoe
have been preserved.

498
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,140
The sole of the shoe
is like a passport.

499
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:44,540
If we're lucky, we'll see
everything he's been up to.

500
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,860
I need that analysis.

501
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,699
Alkaline.

502
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Thank you, John. Molly. Yes.

503
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,580
I... O... U.

504
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,580
Glycerol molecule.

505
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,820
HE SIGHS
What are you?

506
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,980
What did you mean, IOU?

507
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,180
You said IOU.

508
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,620
You were muttering it while you were
working. Nothing, mental note.

509
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,179
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead.
No, sorry.

510
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,240
Molly, please don't
feel the need to make

511
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:53,299
conversation, it's
really not your area.

512
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,139
When he was dying, he was
always cheerful, he was lovely,

513
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,100
except when he thought
no-one could see.

514
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,940
I saw him once, he looked sad.
Molly.

515
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,060
You look sad,
when you think he can't see you.

516
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,019
Are you OK? And don't just say you
are, because I know what that means,

517
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,500
looking sad when you think
no-one can see you.

518
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,580
You can see me. I don't count.

519
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,259
What I'm trying to say is,
that if there's anything I can do,

520
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,059
anything you need, anything at all,
you can have me.

521
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,700
No, I just mean, I mean, if there's
anything you need, it's fine.

522
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,740
But what can I need from you?

523
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,339
Nothing. I don't know.

524
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,500
You could probably say
thank you, actually.

525
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,459
Thank you?

526
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,539
I'm just going to go and get
some crisps. Do you want anything?

527
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,219
It's OK, I know you don't.

528
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,300
Well, actually, maybe I'll...
I know you don't.

529
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,979
Sherlock? Hmm?

530
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,579
This envelope that was in her trunk,
there's another one. What?

531
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,620
On our doorstep. Found it today.
Yes, and look at that.

532
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,900
Look at that, exactly the same seal.

533
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,659
Breadcrumbs. Uh-huh.
It was there when I got back.

534
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,899
A little trace of breadcrumbs.

535
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,100
Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.

536
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,520
Two children led into
the forest by a wicked

537
00:39:44,521 --> 00:39:46,859
father, follow a little
trail of breadcrumbs.

538
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,859
That's Hansel and Gretel.
What sort of kidnapper leaves clues?

539
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,499
The sort that likes to boast,
that thinks it's a game.

540
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,739
He sat in our flat and he said
these exact words to me...

541
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,500
"All fairy tales need
a good old-fashioned villain."

542
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,540
The fifth substance, it's part of
the tale. The witch's house. What?

543
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,700
The glycerol molecule.

544
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,620
PGPR! What's that?
It's used in making chocolate.

545
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,579
This fax arrived an hour ago.

546
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,340
PHONE RINGS

547
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,180
What have you got for us?

548
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:32,040
We need to find a place
in the city where

549
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,899
all five of these
things intersect.

550
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,139
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust,
vegetation.

551
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,019
What... chocolate?! I think we're
looking for a disused sweet factory.

552
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,459
We need to narrow that down.
A sweet factory with asphalt?

553
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,619
No, too general.
Something more specific.

554
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,580
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far
thinner band of geology.

555
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,540
Brick dust?

556
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,939
Building site.
Bricks from the 1950s.

557
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,499
There's thousands of building sites
in London.

558
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,899
I've got people out looking.
So have I!

559
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,339
Homeless network,
faster than the police,

560
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,019
far more relaxed
about taking bribes.

561
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,500
PHONES RING

562
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,819
John.

563
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,380
Rhododendron ponticum. Matches.

564
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,580
Addlestone. What?

565
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:34,859
A mile of disused factories between the
river and the park, matches everything.

566
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,300
Right, come on. Come on!

567
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,100
SIRENS BLARE

568
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,819
OK, you look over there.

569
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,900
Look everywhere.

570
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:54,380
OK, spread out, please, spread out.

571
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,420
(Quietly, quietly!)

572
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,699
This was alight moments ago.
They're still here! Sweet wrappers?

573
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,460
What's he been feeding you?
Hansel and Gretel.

574
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,620
HE SNIFFS

575
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,659
Ugh!

576
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,019
Mercury. What?

577
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,659
The papers, they're painted
with mercury, lethal.

578
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,780
The more they ate...

579
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:29,459
It was killing them. But it's not
enough to kill them on its own.

580
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,099
Taken in large enough quantities,
eventually it would kill them.

581
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,059
He didn't need to be there
for the execution.

582
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,900
Murder by remote control,
he could be 1,000 miles away.

583
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,259
The hungrier they got, the more they
ate, the faster they died. Neat.

584
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,500
Sherlock. Over here!

585
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,780
I've got him, don't worry.

586
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,499
Right then,
the professionals are finished.

587
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,900
If the amateurs want to go in
and have their turn.

588
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:10,019
Now remember, she's in shock
and she's just seven years old,

589
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,099
so, anything you can do to...

590
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,500
Not be myself?
Yeah, might be helpful.

591
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,579
Claudette, I...

592
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,419
SHE SCREAMS No, no, I know
it's been hard for you.

593
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,220
Claudette, listen to me.
Out. Get out!

594
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,899
Makes no sense.
Kid's traumatised.

595
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,979
Something about Sherlock reminds her
of the kidnapper. What's she said?

596
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,659
Hasn't uttered another syllable.
And the boy? No, he's unconscious.

597
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,780
He's still in intensive care.

598
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,780
Don't let it get to you,

599
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,499
I always feel like screaming
when you walk into a room.

600
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,140
In fact, so do most people.

601
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,340
Come on.

SIREN BLARES OUTSIDE

Brilliant work you did finding
those kids from just a footprint,

604
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,300
it's really amazing.

605
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,459
Thank you.

606
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,820
Unbelievable.

607
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,380
Ah.

608
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,580
You OK? Thinking.

609
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,380
This is my cab, you get the next
one. Why? You might talk.

610
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,099
'Is this chocolate?' 'We're looking
for a disused sweet factory.'

611
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,819
'Get out!'

612
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,380
'Aaaargh!'

613
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,420
Problem?

TV BLARES '..this stunning evening wear

Can you turn this off?!

spangly diamond bracelets... '

Hello.

619
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,539
Are you ready for the story?

620
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,100
This is the story
of Sir Boast-a-lot.

621
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,619
A footprint, it's all he had.

622
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,619
A footprint.

623
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,259
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.
CSI Baker Street.

624
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,419
Well, our boys
couldn't have done it.

625
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,699
Well, that's why we need him,
he's better. That's one explanation.

626
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,379
And what's the other?

627
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,579
Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and
cleverest knight at the round table.

628
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,419
But soon the other knights began
to grow tired of his stories

629
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,660
about how brave he was
and how many dragons he'd slain.

630
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,819
And soon they began to wonder, "Are
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?"

631
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,900
Only he could have found
that evidence.

632
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,339
Oh, no.

633
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,280
The girl screams her
head off when she sees

634
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,219
him... a man she has
never seen before,

635
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,899
unless she had seen him before.
What's your point?

636
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,779
You know what it is, you just
don't want to think about it.

637
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,059
So, all of the knights
went to King Arthur and said,

638
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,619
"I don't believe
Sir Boast-a-lot's stories.

639
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,779
"He's just a big old liar who makes
things up to make himself look good."

640
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,580
SHE MOUTHS

641
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,139
You're not seriously suggesting
he's involved, are you?

642
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,220
We have to entertain
the possibility.

643
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,900
And then, even the King
began to wonder.

644
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,660
But that wasn't the end
of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.

645
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:02,980
No.

646
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,940
That wasn't the final problem.

647
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,460
The end.

648
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,019
Stop the cab.

649
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,619
Stop the cab!

650
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,780
What was that?!

651
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,859
What was that?

652
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,900
No charge.

653
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,739
Watch out!

654
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,140
TYRES SQUEAL

655
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,940
Thank you.

656
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,620
GUNFIRE

657
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,140
Sherlock!

658
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,459
That is him. It's him.

659
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,339
Sulejmani or something,
Mycroft showed me his file.

660
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,259
He's a big Albanian gangster,
lives two doors down from us.

661
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,220
He died because I shook his hand.
What?

662
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:10,780
He saved my life,
but he couldn't touch me. Why?

663
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,939
Four assassins
living right on our doorstep.

664
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,859
They haven't come here to kill me.

665
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,459
They have to keep me alive.

666
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,779
I've got something
that all of them want.

667
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,540
But if one of them approaches me...

668
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:25,820
The others kill them
before they can get it.

669
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,620
All of the attention
is focused on me.

670
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,259
There's a surveillance web
closing in on us right now.

671
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,540
So what have you got
that's so important?

672
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,899
I need to ask about the dusting.

673
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,179
Precise details, in the last week,
what's been cleaned?

674
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,219
Tuesday, I did your lino. No, this
room, this is where we'll find it.

675
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,200
Any break in the dust line.

676
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:53,179
You can put back anything but dust.
Dust is eloquent.

677
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,660
(What's he on about?)

678
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,899
Cameras, we're being watched.

679
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,499
What?! Cameras? Here?

680
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,460
DOORBELL RINGS
I'm in my nightie!

681
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,900
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS

682
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,299
No, Inspector. Why?

683
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,739
The answer's no.
You've not heard the question!

684
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,219
You want to take me to the station.
Saving you the trouble of asking.

685
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,979
Sherlock.

686
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,099
The scream? Yeah.

687
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,259
Who was it? Donovan?
I bet it was Donovan.

688
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,659
"Am I somehow responsible
for the kidnapping?"

689
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,259
Ha ha, Moriarty is smart.

690
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,179
He planted that doubt in her head.
That little nagging sensation.

691
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,459
You're going to have to be strong
to resist.

692
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,979
You can't kill an idea, can you?

693
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,220
Not once it's made a home... there.

694
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,659
Will you come? One photograph,
that's his next move.

695
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,099
Moriarty's game.

696
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,019
First the scream, then a photograph
of me being taken in for questioning.

697
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,179
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

698
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,420
It is a game, Lestrade,
and not one I'm willing to play.

699
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

700
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,540
COMPUTER BLEEPS

701
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,379
They'll be deciding. Deciding?

702
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,859
Whether to come back with a warrant
and arrest me. You think?

703
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,499
Standard procedure. You should have
gone with him. People'll think...

704
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,459
I don't care what people think.

705
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,499
You'd care if they thought
you were stupid or wrong.

706
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,899
No, that would just make them
stupid or wrong.

707
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,620
Sherlock, I don't want the world
believing you're...

708
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,180
That I am what?

709
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,780
A fraud.

710
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,860
You're worried they're right.
What?

711
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:17,219
That they're right about me.
No. That's why you're upset.

712
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,979
You can't entertain the possibility
they may be right.

713
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,339
You're afraid you've been taken in.
I'm not.

714
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,020
Moriarty is playing with your mind,
too. Can't you SEE what's going on?!

715
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,299
No, I know you for real.
100 percent?

716
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,780
Well, nobody could fake being such
an annoying dick all the time.

717
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,819
Sherlock Holmes? Yes, sir.

718
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,059
That bloke that's been in the press?

719
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,380
Mm-hm.

720
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,699
I thought he was some sort
of private eye.

721
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,179
He is. We've been consulting with
him, that's what you're telling me?

722
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,299
Not used him on any proper cases
though, have we?

723
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,540
Well, one or two.

724
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,179
Or 20 or 30.

725
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,619
What?!

726
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,939
I'm not the only senior officer
who did this. Gregson... Shut up!

727
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,739
An amateur detective given access to
all sorts of classified information.

728
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,859
And now he's a suspect in a case.

729
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,739
With all due respect...
You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!

730
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,460
Now go and fetch him in, right now.

731
00:52:17,461 --> 00:52:19,020
Do it!

732
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,979
Proud of yourselves? Well,
what if it's not just this case?

733
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,859
What if he's done this to us
every single time?

734
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,340
PHONE BLEEPS

735
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,019
So, still got some friends
on the force. It's Lestrade.

736
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,978
Says they're all
coming over here now.

737
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:49,820
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.

738
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:52,259
Every officer
you've ever made feel like a tit,

739
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,540
which is a lot of people.

740
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,379
Yoo-hoo.

741
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,299
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting?

742
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,259
Some chap delivered a parcel,
I forgot, marked perishable.

743
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,699
I had to sign for it.

744
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,500
Funny name, German,
like the fairy tales.

745
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,500
SIRENS BLARE

746
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,900
Burnt to a crisp.

747
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,859
What does it mean?
DOORBELL RINGS

748
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,700
KNOCKING AT DOOR
'Police!' I'll go.

749
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,259
'Sherlock.

750
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,739
'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson.
We need to talk to you.

751
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,100
'You can't just barge in like that!'

752
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,379
JOHN: 'Have you got a warrant?
Have you?'

753
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,860
LESTRADE: 'Leave it, John.

754
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,939
'Eh? Manners!'

755
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,779
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

756
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,539
It's OK, John. He's not resisting.

757
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,779
No, it's not all right,
this is ridiculous.

758
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,099
Get him downstairs now.

759
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,380
You don't have to do this.

760
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:50,900
Don't try to interfere
or I shall arrest you too.

761
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,219
You done?

762
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,300
I said it. Hmm?

763
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,339
First time we met. Don't bother.

764
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,179
Solving crimes won't be enough.
One day he'll cross the line.

765
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,339
Now ask yourself, what sort of man
would kidnap those kids

766
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,579
just so he can impress us all
by finding them?

767
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,059
Donovan? Sir? Got our man?
Er, yes, sir.

768
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,339
Looked a bit of a weirdo,
if you ask me.

769
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,820
Often are, these vigilante types.

770
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,100
What are you looking at?

771
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,860
Are you all right, sir?

772
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,779
Joining me? Yeah.

773
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,019
Well, apparently it's against the law
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

774
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,979
Hmm. Bit awkward this.

775
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,299
There's no-one to bail us.

776
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,699
I was thinking more about
our imminent and daring escape.

777
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,099
'All units to 27.' What?

778
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,659
'All units to 2... '

779
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,139
ALARM SOUNDS
Aah!

780
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,300
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all
please get on your knees?

781
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,820
GUNFIRE
NOW would be good! Do as he says!

782
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,499
Just so you're aware, the gun
is his idea, I'm just a... you know.

783
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,739
My hostage. Hostage, yes,
that works. That works.

784
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,179
So what now?

785
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,220
Doing what Moriarty wants,
becoming a fugitive. Run!

786
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,220
Get after him, Lestrade!

787
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,019
Take my hand.

788
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,379
SIRENS BLARE

789
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,420
Now people will definitely talk.
The gun! Leave it!

790
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,060
Sherlock, wait!

791
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,380
We're going to need to coordinate.

792
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,099
Go to your right. Huh?
Go to your right.

793
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,180
SIREN BLARES

794
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,379
Everybody wants to believe it,
that's what makes it so clever.

795
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,260
A lie that's preferable
to the truth.

796
00:55:54,261 --> 00:55:56,320
My deductions were a sham.

797
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,379
No-one feels inadequate,
Sherlock's an ordinary man.

798
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,539
Mycroft, he could help us.

799
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:04,340
Big family reconciliation,
now's not really the moment.

800
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,259
Sherlock... we're being followed.
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

801
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,779
That's not the police, it's one of
my new neighbours from Baker Street.

802
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,140
Let's see if he can
give us some answers.

803
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,739
(Where are we going?)

804
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,980
We're going to jump
in front of that bus.

805
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,699
BOTH: Oof!

806
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,579
BUS BLASTS HORN

807
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,740
Oh...

808
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,379
Tell me what you want from me.

809
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,299
Tell me!

810
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,699
He left it at your flat.

811
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,979
Who? Moriarty.

812
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,459
What?

813
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,659
The computer key code. Of course.

814
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,220
He's selling it. The programme
he used to break into the Tower.

815
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,819
He planted it when he came around.

816
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,820
GUNFIRE

817
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,379
SIREN BLARES

818
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,780
THEY PANT

819
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,299
It's a game-changer.

820
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,739
It's a key,
it can break into any system

821
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,499
and it's sitting in our flat
right now.

822
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,579
That's why he left that message, telling
everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!"

823
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,059
We need to get back into the flat
and search. CID will be camped out.

824
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,499
Why plant it on you?

825
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,779
It's another subtle way
of smearing my name,

826
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,060
now I'm best pals
with all those criminals.

827
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,139
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

828
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:39,059
A kiss-and-tell.

829
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,020
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

830
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,500
Who is he?

831
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,100
ALARM BLEEPS

832
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,220
Too late to go on the record?

833
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,659
Congratulations,
"The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."

834
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,819
The scoop that everybody wanted
and you got it. Bravo!

835
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,779
I gave you your opportunity.

836
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,979
I wanted to be on your side,
remember?

837
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,260
You turned me down, so...

838
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:28,139
Then lo and behold,
someone spills all the beans.

839
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,379
How utterly convenient.
Who is Brook?

840
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,699
Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts
the voice at the end of a phone.

841
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,779
All those little meetings in cafes,

842
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,339
those sessions in the hotel room when
he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

843
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,579
How do you know
that you can trust him?

844
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,859
A man turns up
with the Holy Grail in his pockets.

845
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,340
What were his credentials?

846
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,660
Darling, they didn't have any
ground coffee, so I just got normal.

847
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:04,459
You said that they wouldn't find me
here, you said that I'd be safe here.

848
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,499
You are safe.

849
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,939
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't
harm you in front of witnesses.

850
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,339
So that's your source?
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

851
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,099
Of course he's Richard Brook,
there is no Moriarty.

852
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,939
There never has been. What are you
talking about? Look him up.

853
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,660
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes
hired to be Moriarty.

854
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,339
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,

855
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,699
don't, don't, don't hurt me.

856
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,699
No, you are Moriarty!
He's Moriarty!

857
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,699
We've met, remember?
You were going to blow me up!

858
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,179
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

859
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,819
He paid me, I needed the work.
I'm an actor, I was out of work.

860
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,059
Sherlock, you'd better explain,
because I am not getting this.

861
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,779
I'll be doing the explaining,
in print.

862
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,540
It's all here, conclusive proof.

863
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,539
You invented James Moriarty,
your nemesis.

864
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,379
Invented him?! Mm-hm.

865
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,819
He invented all the crimes,
actually.

866
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,339
And to cap it all,
he made up a master villain.

867
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,979
Don't be ridiculous! Ask him.
He's right here. Just ask him.

868
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,259
Tell him, Richard. For God's sake,
this man was on trial!

869
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,099
Yes, and you paid him to take the
rap. Promised you'd rig the jury.

870
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,539
Not exactly a West End role,
but I'll bet the money was good.

871
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,419
But not so good he didn't
want to sell his story.

872
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,979
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.

873
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,619
So this is the story
you're going to publish?

874
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,819
The big conclusion of it all,
Moriarty's an actor? He knows I am.

875
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,819
I have proof. Show them...
Kitty, show them something.

876
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,820
Yeah, show me something.

877
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,180
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV.
I'm the story-teller.

878
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,540
I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD.

879
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,979
Just tell him.
It's all coming out. It's all over.

880
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,459
Just tell them. Just tell them.
Tell them! It's all over now!

881
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,499
No! Don't you touch me!
Don't you lay a finger on me!

882
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,539
Stop it now!

883
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,099
Don't hurt me!
Don't let him get away!

884
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,420
Leave him alone!

885
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,419
No, no, no. He'll have back-up.

886
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,379
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

887
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:28,900
I look at you know and I can
read you... and you repel me.

888
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,379
Can he do that?

889
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,259
Completely change his identity,
make you the criminal?

890
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,179
He's got my whole life story.

891
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,259
That's what you do
when you sell a big lie,

892
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,899
you wrap it up in the truth
to make it more palatable.

893
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,739
It'll be your word against his.

894
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,939
He's been sowing doubt into
people's minds for 24 hours.

895
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,940
There's only one thing he needs to
do to complete his game and that...

896
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,380
Sherlock?

897
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,500
There's something I need to do.
What? Can I help? No, on my own.

898
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,180
You're wrong, you know?

899
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,380
You do count.

900
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:27,900
You've always counted
and I've always trusted you.

901
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,220
But you were right.

902
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,019
I'm not OK.

903
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,300
Tell me what's wrong.

904
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,580
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

905
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,019
What do you need? If I wasn't
everything that you think I am,

906
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,220
everything that I think I am...

907
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,540
would you still want to help me?

908
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,340
What do you need?

909
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,260
You.

910
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,939
She has really done her homework,
Miss Riley,

911
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,940
and it's things that only someone
close to Sherlock could know.

912
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,419
Ah. Have you seen your brother's
address book lately?

913
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,939
Two names... yours and mine...

914
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,939
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff
from me.

915
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,459
John... So how does it work,
your relationship?

916
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,139
Do you go out for a coffee
now and then, you and Jim?

917
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,339
Your own brother

918
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,220
and you blabbed about his entire
life to this maniac.

919
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,939
I never intend... I never dreamt...

920
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:03,019
This... this is what you were
trying to tell me, isn't it?

921
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,940
"Watch his back
because I've made a mistake."

922
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,500
How did you meet him?

923
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,260
People like him,
we know about them, we watch them.

924
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,940
But James Moriarty...

925
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,219
the most dangerous criminal mind
the world has ever seen,

926
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,339
and, in his pocket,
the ultimate weapon.

927
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,459
The key code.

928
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,420
A few lines of computer code
that can unlock any door.

929
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:43,940
And you abducted him
to try and find the key code?

930
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,459
Interrogated him for weeks.

931
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,500
And? He wouldn't play along.

932
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,179
He just sat there

933
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,940
staring into the darkness.

934
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,940
The only thing that made him
open up...

935
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,940
I could get him to talk,
just a little.

936
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,179
But...

937
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,740
In return you had to offer him
Sherlock's life story.

938
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,220
So, one big lie...

939
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,259
Sherlock's a fraud,

940
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:28,060
and people will swallow it
because the rest of it's true.

941
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,579
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed,
right,

942
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,940
and you have given him
the perfect ammunition.

943
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,940
John.

944
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,659
I'm sorry.

945
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,580
Oh, please!

946
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,420
Tell him, would you?

947
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,659
I got your message.

948
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,259
The computer code is the key to
this. We find it, we can use it.

949
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,179
Use it? He used it to create
a false identity

950
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,019
so we can break into the records
and destroy Richard Brook.

951
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,699
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.

952
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,780
Somewhere in 221b,

953
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:24,579
somewhere on the day of the verdict
he left it hidden.

954
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,940
Uh-huh.

955
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,819
What did he touch?
An apple, nothing else.

956
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,540
Did he write anything down?
No.

957
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,940
MOBILE RINGS

958
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,940
Oh.

959
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,579
Yeah, speaking.

960
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,859
What?

961
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:30,779
What happened? Is she OK?

962
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,339
Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.

963
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,539
What is it? Paramedics.
Mrs Hudson's been shot.

964
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,819
How? Probably one of the killers
you managed to attract. Jesus!

965
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,659
She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.
You go. I'm busy.

966
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,219
Busy?!
Thinking. I need to think.

967
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,859
You need to...?
Doesn't she mean anything to you?

968
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,779
You once half-killed a man
because he laid a finger on her.

969
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:54,619
She's my landlady.
She's dying... you machine!

970
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:57,939
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here
if you want, on your own.

971
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,459
Alone is what I have.
Alone protects me.

972
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,540
No, friends protect people.

973
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,260

You and me, Sherlock.

01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,579
And our problem... the final problem.

984
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,660
Staying alive!

985
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,020
It's so boring, isn't it?

986
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,420
It's just staying.

987
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,419
All my life I've been searching
for distractions

988
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,499
and you were the best distraction
and now I don't even have you

989
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,859
because I've beaten you.

990
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,940
And you know what?
In the end, it was easy.

991
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,019
It was easy.

992
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:20,299
Now I've got to go back to playing
with the ordinary people,

993
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,420
and it turns out you're ordinary,
just like all of them.

994
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,340
Ah, well.

995
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,579
Did you almost start to wonder
if I was real?

996
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:35,259
Did I nearly get you?

997
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,619
Richard Brook.

998
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,699
Nobody seems to get the joke,
but you do.

999
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,779
Of course. Attaboy.

1000
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,499
Richard Brook in German
is Reichenbach.

1001
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,580
The case that made my name.
Just trying to have some fun.

1002
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,020
Good. You got that too.

1003
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,939
Beats like digits.

1004
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:05,939
Every beat is a one,
every rest is a zero.

1005
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,619
Binary code.

1006
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,459
That's why all those assassins
tried to save my life.

1007
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,139
It was hidden on me,
hidden inside my head.

1008
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,579
A few simple lines of computer code
that can break into any system.

1009
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:21,059
Told all my clients,
last one to Sherlock is a sissy.

1010
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,940
But now that it's up here, I can
use it to alter all the records.

1011
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:30,900
I can kill Rich Brook
and bring back Jim Moriarty.

1012
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,219
No, no, no, no, no.
This is too easy.

1013
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,139
This is too easy.

1014
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,620
There is no key, doofus!

1015
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:48,059
Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.

1016
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,659
You don't really think a couple
of lines of computer code

1017
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,339
are going to crash the world
around our ears?

1018
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,019
I'm disappointed in you,
ordinary Sherlock.

1019
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:02,579
But the rhythm... Partita no 1!
Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

1020
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,640
But then how did you...
? How did I break

1021
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:06,699
into the bank, to the
Tower, to the prison?

1022
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,940
Daylight robbery! All it takes
is some willing participants.

1023
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,739
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.

1024
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,179
You always want everything
to be clever.

1025
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:24,859
Shall we finish the game?
One final act.

1026
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,299
Glad you chose a tall building.
Nice way to do it.

1027
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,340
Do it? Do what?

1028
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,940
Yes, of course.

1029
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,459
My suicide.

1030
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,019
Genius detective
proved to be a fraud.

1031
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,779
I read it in the paper
so it must be true.

1032
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,219
I love newspapers.

1033
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,300
Fairy tales.

1034
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,940
And pretty grim ones too.

1035
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:06,099
Oh, God, John, you made me jump.
Is everything OK with the police?

1036
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,740
Has Sherlock sorted it all out?

1037
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,260
Oh, my God.

1038
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,620
Taxi!

1039
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:22,219
Taxi!
No, no, no. Police... sort of!

1040
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,219
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!

1041
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:27,259
I can prove that you created
an entirely false identity.

1042
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,420
Oh, just kill yourself.
It's a lot less effort.

1043
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,779
Go on.

1044
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,219
For me.

1045
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,940
Please!

1046
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,620
You're insane.

1047
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,259
You're just getting that now?
Wo-wo-wo!

1048
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,940
OK.

1049
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,779
Let me give you a little extra
incentive.

1050
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:55,940
Your friends will die if you don't.

1051
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,219
John?

1052
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,420
Not just John. Everyone.

1053
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,339
Mrs Hudson? Everyone.

1054
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:10,219
Lestrade? Three bullets,
three gunmen, three victims.

1055
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,660
There's no stopping them now...

1056
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:17,180
unless my people see you jump.

1057
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,339
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

1058
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,939
you can do anything you like
with me,

1059
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:34,539
but nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

1060
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,819
Your only three friends in the world
will die unless...

1061
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,940
Unless I kill myself
and complete your story.

1062
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,739
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1063
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:49,419
And I die in disgrace. Of course.
That's the point of this.

1064
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,500
Oh. You've got an audience now.

1065
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,940
Off you pop.

1066
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,340
Go on.

1067
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,500
I told you how this ends.

1068
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,659
Your death is the only thing that's
going to call off the killers.

1069
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:11,940
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1070
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,700
Would you give me one moment,
please?

1071
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,820
One moment of privacy.

1072
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,340
Please.

1073
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,220
Of course.

1074
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,620
HE LAUGHS

1075
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,659
What?!

1076
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,860
What is it?

1077
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,940
What did I miss?

1078
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,339
You're not going to do it.

1079
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,339
So the killers can be called off,

1080
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,340
then there's a recall code
or a word or a number.

1081
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,299
I don't have to die

1082
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,259
if I've got you.

1083
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,900
Oh!

1084
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,579
You think you can make me
stop the order?

1085
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,939
You think you can make me do that?
Yes.

1086
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,859
So do you. Sherlock, your big
brother and all the King's horses

1087
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,379
couldn't make me do a thing
I didn't want to.

1088
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,740
Yes, but I'm not my brother,
remember?

1089
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,939
I am you.

1090
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:38,139
Prepared to do anything.

1091
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,339
Prepared to burn.

1092
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:44,019
Prepared to do what ordinary
people won't do.

1093
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:48,860
You want me to shake hands with you
in hell? I shall not disappoint you.

1094
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,540
Nah.

1095
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,099
You talk big.

1096
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,099
Nah.

1097
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,179
You're ordinary.

1098
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,139
You're ordinary.
You're on the side of the angels.

1099
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,219
Oh, I may be on the side
of the angels,

1100
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:10,940
but don't think for one second
that I am one of them.

1101
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,700
No...

1102
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,420
you're not.

1103
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,900
I see.

1104
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,699
You're not ordinary.

1105
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,220
No.

1106
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:40,500
You're me.

1107
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,140
You're me.

1108
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,100
Thank you...

1109
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,140
Sherlock Holmes.

1110
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,100
Thank you.

1111
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,940
Bless you.

1112
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:12,940
As long as I'm alive, you can save
your friends, you've got a way out.

1113
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,060
Well, good luck with that.

1114
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,940
No.

1115
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,780
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

Hello?

1118
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,659
John.
Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?

1119
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,979
Turn around and walk back
the way you came. I'm coming in.

1120
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,139
Just do as I ask!

1121
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,539
Please.

1122
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,260
Where?

1123
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,459
Stop there.

1124
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:57,620
Sherlock?
OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.

1125
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,219
Oh, God.

1126
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,699
I... I can't come down, so we'll
just have to do it like this.

1127
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,899
What's going on?

1128
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,860
An apology.

1129
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,939
It's all true.

1130
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,939
What?

1131
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:21,180
Everything they said about me.
I invented Moriarty.

1132
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,260
Why are you saying this?

1133
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,219
I'm a fake.

1134
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,899
Sherlock...
The newspapers were right all along.

1135
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:40,939
I want you to tell Lestrade,

1136
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:44,699
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson
and Molly.

1137
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,660
In fact, tell anyone who will
listen to you...

1138
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,420
that I created Moriarty
for my own purposes.

1139
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,019
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.

1140
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,899
The first time we met...
the first time we met,

1141
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:02,419
you knew all about my sister, right?
Nobody could be that clever.

1142
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,300
You could.

1143
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,340
I researched you.

1144
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:18,539
Before we met, I discovered
everything that I could

1145
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,820
to impress you.

1146
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,539
It's a trick. Just a magic trick.

1147
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,859
No. All right, stop it now.

1148
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:29,420
No. Stay exactly where you are.

1149
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,340
Don't move. All right.

1150
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:37,019
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1151
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,379
Please, will you do this for me?
Do what?

1152
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,060
This phone call, it's...

1153
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,940
it's my note.

1154
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,740
It's what people do, don't they?

1155
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,580
Leave a note?

1156
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,339
Leave a note when?

1157
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,300
Goodbye, John. No. Don't...

1158
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,860
Sherlock!

1159
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,740
Sherlock.

1160
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:07,220
Sherlock... Sherlock.

1161
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,059
I'm a doctor, let me come through.
Let me come through, please.

1162
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,500
He's my friend. He's my friend...
Please.

1163
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,820
Please, let me just...

1164
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,339
Oh, Jesus!

1165
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,019
No.

1166
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,700
God, no.

1167
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:26,340
There's stuff that you wanted
to say...

1168
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,940
but didn't say it. Yeah.

1169
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,620
Say it now.

1170
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,220
Sorry, I can't.

1171
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:57,939
There's all the stuff.
All the science equipment.

1172
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,419
I left it all in boxes.
I don't know what needs doing.

1173
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,940
I thought I'd take it to a school.

1174
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:09,940
Would you...? I can't go back to
the flat again, not at the moment.

1175
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,419
I'm angry.

1176
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,339
It's OK, John.
There's nothing unusual in that.

1177
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,899
That's the way he made
everyone feel.

1178
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,579
All the marks on my table
and the noise,

1179
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,899
firing guns at half past one
in the morning... Yeah.

1180
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,299
Bloody specimens in my fridge.

1181
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,419
Imagine, keeping bodies
where there's food. Yes.

1182
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:36,459
And the fighting! Drove me up
the wall with all his carryings-on.

1183
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,139
Listen, I'm not actually that angry,
OK?

1184
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:43,180
OK. I'll leave you alone to,
you know...

1185
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,580
Erm...

1186
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,939
Hmm.

1187
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,940
You... you told me once...

1188
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,299
that you weren't a hero.

1189
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,099
Erm, there were times I didn't
even think you were human,

1190
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:11,219
but let me tell you this,
you were...

1191
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:12,899
the best man...

1192
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:17,899
the most human... human being
that I've ever known

1193
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:21,940
and no-one will ever convince me
that you told me a lie, so...

1194
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,140
there.

1195
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,180
I was so alone...

1196
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,940
and I owe you so much.

1197
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:45,979
But, please, there's just one
more thing, one more thing,

1198
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:49,380
one more miracle, Sherlock,
for me, don't be...

1199
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,419
dead.

1200
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,899
Would you do that just for me?

1201
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,260
Just stop it. Stop this.

1202
